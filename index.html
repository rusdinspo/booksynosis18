This was a time when heroes were getting darker and more extreme in their methods, and the style of the era didn't seem to allow for a character like Superman to keep his relevance. By removing Superman from the equation, we - and the characters in the DCU - learned how important Superman was as an icon, and his return was all the more impactful. This storyline brought the real and fictional universes together in a stirring realization of just how much Superman means to our culture."--IGN</p><h2>The L.A.

A young cop morphs into obsessed lover and lust-crazed avenger. The Dahlia claims him. She is the deus ex machina of a boomtown in extremis. The cop's rogue investigation is a one-way ticket to hell.<br><br><i>The Big Nowhere</i> blends the crime novel and the political novel. It is winter, 1950--and the L.A.

A. Confidential</i>, and&nbsp;<i>White Jazz</i>.&nbsp;He&nbsp;lives&nbsp;in&nbsp;Colorado.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>James Ellroy&#x2019;s breakthrough into crime-fiction success in the late 1980s was comparable in its impact and controversy to&#x2014;what? Perhaps the 1913 Paris debut of Igor Stravinsky&#x2019;s notorious, upsetting, violent ballet-score <i>The Rite of Spring</i>. Splice that with anyone&#x2019;s first glimpse of the eyeball scene in Bunuel and Dali&#x2019;s 1929 <i>e�pater-les-bourgeois </i>film <i>Un Chien Andalou. </i>A more American parallel might be the furor created in swing-jazz circles in the 1940s when a cadre of New York musicians gave birth to the raucous, frenzied sounds of bebop&#x2014;or when, in the &#x2019;50s, rhythm and blues and rockabilly spawned the decadent, repetitive, aggressive sounds of rock&#x2019;n&#x2019;roll: a musical-verbal-sensual poke in the ear to white-bread sensibilities.<br><br> This author&#x2019;s in-your-face novels gave you verbatim police reports, period radio-chatter, self-righteous scandal-sheet tease, sober newspaper prose, thought-patterns, brainstorms, stream of subconsciousness dreads: all transcribed or telepathed with kaleidoscope clarity. Place-names and call-letters and street-numbers and local celebs put you right back in the 1950s: KGFJ, KMPC, Hody&#x2019;s on Vine Street, the Pacific Dining Car; Scrivner&#x2019;s Drive-in, Tiny Naylor&#x2019;s, Sy Devore, Spade Cooley, Jerry Geisler.<br><br> Ellroy&#x2019;s books, especially the four gathered in this volume, seemed unlike any detective- or crime-fiction written yet: a scary m�lange of grisly murders, perverse obsessions, civic corruption, corrosive cynicism and contagious evil. And butcherous violence. These books had protagonists, not heroes. Ostensibly police-procedurals, their cops were often as thuggish, larcenous, and murderous as the gangsters with whom they oft collaborated. Expediency was the best policy for them, and their first commandment was survival.<br><br> Ellroy&#x2019;s semi-antiheroes reminded some older readers and critics of Mickey Spillane&#x2019;s Mike Hammer, that post-World War II private-eye who inflicted mayhem on foes both male and female with a glee that could seem fascistic. The English novelist and detective-fiction scholar Julian Symons, for one, was repelled by the matter-of-fact manner in which Ellroy depicted (hence, it might seem, condoned) violence: &#x2018;&#x2018;I banged his head against the wall, threw him out the window screaming&#x2019;&#x2019; (chapter 2, <i>White Jazz</i>). But other knowledgeable commentators saw Ellroy as being squarely (if jarringly) in the all-American hard-boiled tradition: Richard Layman, the premier chronicler of Dashiell Hammett (whose <i>Red Harvest</i> was, it could be said, the <i>White Jazz </i>of 1929) judged of <i>The</i> <i>Black Dahlia </i>and its author: &#x2018;&#x2018;Ellroy is here to stay. Our great-grandchildren will be reading this book.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br> It was in <i>The Black Dahlia </i>(1987)&#x2014;a fiction work based on the nightmarish real-life murder of Elizabeth Short, the most notorious unsolved crime in Los Angeles history&#x2014;that James Ellroy displayed his mature vision and was rewarded with bestselling success.<br><br> The hallmarks of Ellroy&#x2019;s soon-familiar style are on full display here. The intersection of historical figures with fictional characters is presented in audacious, take-it-or-leave-it fashion. The scenes of slaughter and depravity are worthy of a Tijuana-bible drawn by H. Bosch (the painter, not Michael Connelly&#x2019;s cop). Racial epithets&#x2014;the n-word, the j-word, the other j-word, and on and beyond&#x2014;are ubiquitous, seeming much more shocking on the page of a 1980s depiction of 1950s L.A. than they were in Raymond Chandler&#x2019;s 1930s/&#x2019;40s books; our awareness of those ugly words coming out of Philip Marlowe&#x2019;s mouth somehow gets lost in Chandler&#x2019;s romantic fog.<br><br> Framing the novel&#x2019;s search for the Black Dahlia killer is the friendship and sometimes partnership of two cops, Bucky Bleichert (the novel&#x2019;s narrator) and Lee Blanchard: both exboxers, both in love with the smart and passionate Kay, an experienced woman who bears a checkered and traumatic past with dignity. The cop duo negotiate a milieu in which they interact with such real-life figures as mobsters Bugsy Siegel and Mickey Cohen, and where police higher-ups and civic officials take advantage of high-profile crimes to advance their own careers and inflate their budgets.<br> Inexorably but in unpredictable ways, Lee and Bucky each become possessed by the memory of Elizabeth Short (&#x2018;&#x2018;Betty&#x2019;&#x2019;) whose brief, sordid life and cruel death stir up and supplement their own worst memories of physical and moral pain suffered and inflicted.<br><br> Of <i>The Black Dahlia</i>, Ellroy would later write: &#x2018;&#x2018;The novel is phrased as a young man coming of age in a hell of his own making. Bucky Bleichert is solely responsible for his own descent. He made specious moral choices early in life and brought a grievously flawed soul to the Dahlia.&#x2019;&#x2019; But in moving forward, he is able in part to mend: &#x2018;&#x2018;Love requires self-sacrifice and deference. Bucky Bleichert learns that and achieves a tenuous peace.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br> There seems no peace in store at first in <i>The Big Nowhere</i>, Ellroy&#x2019;s unrelenting follow-up to the best-selling <i>Dahlia</i>. Set in 1950, three years after the (still unsolved of course) killing of Elizabeth Short, it too begins with a horrific murder involving a mutilated corpse: &#x2018;&#x2018;Eyes poked out. Sex organs mauled. Bare flesh gored down to the quick.&#x2019;&#x2019; But this victim is male, the killing has apparent homosexual aspects, and the powers that be want to clamp a lid on press coverage, hoping to avoid &#x2018;&#x2018;another Black Dahlia mess.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br> Catching the unwanted case is L.A. Sheriff&#x2019;s deputy Danny Upshaw: a studious, ascetic rookie whose career choice was prompted by the haunting memory of glimpsing two men in a farmhouse at night attacking a blonde woman with axes, this surreal vision (&#x2018;&#x2018;a half-second flash of an arm severed off&#x2019;&#x2019;) viewed as Upshaw raced a stolen car to Bakersfield during an adolescent criminal stint. Thus the would-be crook became a cop instead, with an abiding need to comprehend the roots of evil: &#x2018;&#x2018;to know WHY.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br> It never rains but it pours: soon Upshaw encounters two more related murders, even more brutal (you may not want the details, but you&#x2019;ll get them). To win the chance to be in charge of investigating these linked slaughters, Upshaw agrees to join a covert grand-jury investigation documenting Communist infiltration of the movie business. Among the other Red-hunters is Turner &#x2018;&#x2018;Buzz&#x2019;&#x2019; Meeks, native of Lizard Ridge, Oklahoma: &#x2018;&#x2018;heroin skimmer, shakedown artist, bagman and now a glorified pimp for Howard Hughes&#x2019;&#x2019; and &#x2018;&#x2018;the man who held the possible distinction of being the single most crooked cop in the history of the Los Angeles Police Department.&#x2019;&#x2019; Meeks is comfortable in the niche he&#x2019;s found between law and ordure, but he develops a fatal flaw (or, in Ellroy&#x2019;s theology, a chance for redemption): his lust-driven love for Audrey &#x2018;&#x2018;the Va-Va-Voom Girl&#x2019;&#x2019; Anders, mobster Mickey Cohen&#x2019;s stripper girlfriend. &#x2018;&#x2018;I&#x2019;m glad bein&#x2019; with you is dangerous,&#x2019;&#x2019; Buzz tells Audrey, once their crush is physically consummated. &#x2018;&#x2018;It feels good.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br> Also among the elite Red-hunters is Lt. Mal Considine, District Attorney&#x2019;s investigator, a man trapped in a wretched marriage entered into to protect a stepson he dotes upon; Mal develops an unexpected romantic interest in Claire De Haven, glamorous Hollywood activist and fianc� of a fading movie star. Rounding out the conspiracy committee (under the leadership of hyper-ambitious Ellis Loew, head of the DA&#x2019;s Criminal Division) is LAPD Homicide Detective Dudley Smith: Dublin-born, Jesuit-trained, glib, blarney-spouting oozer of insidious charm, wily as the snake in Genesis: &#x2018;&#x2018;Knock knock, who&#x2019;s there? Dudley Smith, so Reds beware.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br> Ellroy&#x2019;s conflicted characters have fault-lines as deep as the San Andreas. They battle and indulge their obsessions, compulsions and repulsions in the context of their work, which plays into and out against a broader historical context. The gruesome murders Upshaw probes have evidentiary links to the Zoot Suit riots and Sleepy Lagoon killings of a few years back&#x2014;which also have relevance for the DA commission&#x2019;s charting of left-wing Hollywood activism. The liberals&#x2019; current cause, in support of a Hollywood trade-union picketing Howard Hughes&#x2019; studio for better pay, puts the left-wingers in opposition to Mickey Cohen&#x2019;s mob, which supports the rival Teamsters union. The crime mobs themselves are in longstanding opposition, with Cohen&#x2019;s outfit pitted against Jack Dragna&#x2019;s crew&#x2014;which is protected by a squad of the LAPD, while the West Hollywood Sheriff &#x2019;s Department gives Mickey Cohen cover.<br><br> Agendas clash. Obsessions rage. Yet the bizarre cases (which may or may not have much to do with the &#x2018;&#x2018;larger issues&#x2019;&#x2019; at hand) still must in some fashion or other be solved. Cops as different from one another as Upshaw and Meeks, driven by the best and worst of motives, comb through old booking slips and arrest reports, coerce witnesses, call in favors, break as many rules as they hope to enforce in search of THE fiendish soul whose repulsive acts go beyond baroque into the obscenely rococo.<br><br> Guilt proves especially difficult to fix in <i>L.A. Confidential</i>, third and longest of the L.A. Quartet books. Trying as hard as anyone to prove who&#x2019;s responsible for the after-hours deaths of six customers at Hollywood&#x2019;s Nite Owl Cafe� in 1953 is the cold and manipulative Ed Exley, son of a former policeman turned construction magnate. Though decorated for his World War II service (thanks to a somewhat padded official record), Ed is despised by his LAPD colleagues as a cowardly martinet. Though a desk-officer, not a field cop, he takes a hands-on approach to the Nite Owl case when the obvious (convenient) suspects&#x2014;three young black men the police claim have confessed&#x2014; escape from jail but are soon run to ground. Exley beards them in their lair and single-handedly assassinates them (what, self-defense?)&#x2014;then lives to confront the unexpected consequences, when in &#x2019;58 new evidence proves the shotgunned suspects couldn&#x2019;t have been the Nite Owl killers after all.<br><br> No worries. &#x2018;&#x2018;That&#x2019;s blood under the bridge,&#x2019;&#x2019; says Dudley Smith, one of several recidivist characters making recurring appearances throughout the Quartet. Exley, Smith and the other men serving with and under Ed simply &#x2018;&#x2018;solve&#x2019;&#x2019; the case again&#x2014;this time, they insist, for real. Among Exley&#x2019;s minions: Wendell &#x2018;&#x2018;Bud&#x2019;&#x2019; White: &#x2018;&#x2018;frustrated because he wasn&#x2019;t that smart, he wasn&#x2019;t really a Homicide detective&#x2014;he was the guy they brought in to scare other guys shitless.&#x2019;&#x2019; Then there&#x2019;s Jack &#x2018;&#x2018;the Big V&#x2019;&#x2019; Vincennes, official police adviser to the TV show <i>Badge of Honor </i>(a lot like <i>Dragnet</i>, aka <i>Badge 714</i>), engineer of juicy cop stories for <i>Hush-Hush </i>magazine (remember <i>Confidential</i>?), whose sex life has been turned rancid by twisted fantasies and who lives in despair of being exposed as a cop fraud and political fixer.<br><br> Multiple homicides, a botched pornography racket, strange interlocking criminal conspiracies and personality-disorder flameouts complicate matters. For plot twists and switchbacks and Mobius-strip encounters, post-modern authors such as John Barth or Thomas Pynchon have nothing on Ellroy, whose moments of surprising subtlety and out-of-the-blue sentiment nonetheless ground his fiction in the real world in which we live. <br><br> That world is no less astounding and perilous in the Quartet&#x2019;s final novel, <i>White Jazz</i>, set in 1958. After decades of having things their own ways, L.A.&#x2019;s cops and mobsters are to come under the scrutiny of federal investigators hoping to indict those enmeshed in the crooked local prize-fight racket and maybe sundry other illicit endeavors to boot. Down-on-his-luck Mickey Cohen has meanwhile branched into low-budget film-making on location in Griffith Park. And in the nearby Hollywood Hills, a creepy killer has been victimizing alcoholic hobos; the gutter-press dubs the fiend the &#x2018;&#x2018;Wino Will-o-the-Wisp.&#x2019;&#x2019;<br><br> Ed Exley, now LAPD Chief of Detectives, gives Lt.

(Apologies if that spoils things for anyone. Think of it as something to look forward to.)<br><br> Thumbnail summaries do not suffice. These books spiel out with a mind-boggling, memory-taunting complexity of plot, thought and conjecture that rivals or surpasses the crazy cat&#x2019;scradles of Ross Macdonald (<i>aka </i>Kenneth Millar), a writer Ellroy dedicated a book to and invoked in the epigraph to <i>White Jazz</i>. As with Macdonald, even the minor characters in Ellroy&#x2019;s books are fleshed out with quick strokes that would do Goya or Daumier proud. But then that sudden violence: blood-soaked action fit to make Spillane chuckle&#x2014;or gasp, depending.<br><br> For some, Ellroy&#x2019;s most notable achievement will be the inducement in readers of sympathy (or at least empathy) (or at the very least, some understanding) for initially unforgivable-seeming characters such as Dave Klein. How comprehend his villainous deeds in any context other than greed and evil? But as Klein shares his backstory in first-person voice, we comprehend: passionate (okay, incestuous) family loyalty made him vulnerable to gangsters who twisted his chivalric impulses to homicidal ends, then insisted he keep &#x2018;&#x2018;paying them back&#x2019;&#x2019; with more killings until he felt hooked for life.<br><br> This is the sort of thing that happens in Ellroy&#x2019;s world, a universe of raunchy sex with movie stars, bordellos with fake-believe actresses, and once-real people&#x2014;L.A. police chief Bill Parker, police chemist Ray Pinker&#x2014;saying and doing madeup things.

The now famous diary of her private life and thoughts reveals only part of Anne&#x2019;s story, however. This book rounds out the portrait of this remarkable and talented young author.<br><br>Newly translated, complete, and restored to the original order in which Anne herself wrote them in her notebook, <b>Tales from the Secret Annex</b> is a collection of Anne Frank&#x2019;s lesser-known writings: short stories, fables, personal reminiscences, and an unfinished novel, <b>Cady&#x2019;s Life</b>.</p><p><b>Anne Frank</b> was born in 1929 in Germany. Her family moved to Amsterdam in 1933, and she died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Her diary, published as <i>The Diary of a Young Girl, </i>which documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944, is one of the world's most widely known books and has been the basis for several plays and films.<b>Was There a Break-in?<br><br>Wednesday evening, March 24, 1943<br><br></b>Mother, Father, Margot and I were sitting quite pleasantly together when Peter suddenly came in and whispered in Father's ear. I caught the words "a barrel falling over in the warehouse" and "someone fiddling with the door."<br><br>Margot heard it too, but was trying to calm me down, since I'd turned white as chalk and was extremely nervous. The three of us waited. In the meantime Father and Peter went downstairs, and a minute or two later Mrs. van Daan came up from where she'd been listening to the radio. She told us that Pim had asked her to switch it off and tiptoe upstairs. But you know what happens when you're trying to be quiet--the old stairs creaked twice as loud. Five minutes later Peter and Pim, the color drained from their faces, appeared again to relate their experiences.<br><br>They had positioned themselves under the staircase and waited. Nothing happened. Then all of a sudden they heard a couple of bangs, as if two doors had been slammed shut inside the house. Pim bounded up the stairs, while Peter went to warn Dussel, who finally presented himself upstairs, though not without kicking up a fuss and making a lot of noise. Then we all tiptoed in our stockinged feet to the van Daan family on the next floor. Mr. van D. had a bad cold and had already gone to bed, so we gathered around his bedside and discussed our suspicions in a whisper.<br><br>Every time Mr. van D. coughed loudly, Mrs. van D. and I nearly had a nervous fit. He kept coughing until someone came up with the bright idea of giving him codeine. His cough subsided immediately.<br><br>Once again we waited and waited, but heard nothing. Finally we came to the conclusion that the burglars had fled when they heard footsteps in an otherwise quiet building. The problem now was that the chairs in the private office were neatly grouped round the radio, which was tuned to England. If the burglars had forced the door and the air-raid wardens were to notice it and call the police, that would get the ball rolling, and there could be very serious repercussions. So Mr. van Daan got up, pulled on his coat and pants, put on his hat and cautiously followed Father down the stairs, with Peter (armed with a heavy hammer, to be on the safe side) right behind him. The ladies (including Margot and me) waited in suspense until the men returned five minutes later and told us that there was no sign of any activity in the building. We agreed not to run any water or flush the toilet; but since everyone's stomach was churning from all the tension, you can imagine the stench after we'd each had a turn in the bathroom.<br><br>Incidents like these are always accompanied by other disasters, and this was no exception. Number one: the Westertoren bells stopped chiming, and they were always so comforting. Plus Mr. Voskuijl left early last night, and we weren't sure if he'd given Bep the key and she'd forgotten to lock the door.<br><br>Well, the night had just begun, and we still weren't sure what to expect. We were somewhat reassured by the fact that between eight-fifteen--when the burglar had first entered the building--and ten-thirty, we hadn't heard a sound. The more we thought about it, the less likely it seemed that a burglar would have forced a door so early in the evening, when there were still people out on the streets. Besides that, it occurred to us that the warehouse manager at the Keg Company next door might still have been at work. What with the excitement and the thin walls, it's easy to mistake the sounds. Besides, your imagination often plays tricks on you in moments of danger.<br><br>So we lay down on our beds, though not to sleep. Father and Mother and Mr. Dussel were awake most of the night, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that I hardly got a wink of sleep. This morning the men went downstairs to see if the outside door was still locked, but all was well!<br><br>Of course, we gave the entire office staff a blow-by-blow account of the incident, which had been far from pleasant. It's much easier to laugh at these kinds of things after they've happened, and Bep was the only one who took us seriously.<br><br>Note: The next morning the toilet was clogged, and Father had to stick in a long wooden pole and fish out several pounds of excrement and strawberry recipes (which is what we use for toilet paper these days). Afterward we burned the pole.<br><br><b>The Dentist<br><br>Wednesday, December 8, 1942<br><br></b>The nicest spectacle I've ever seen here took place today: Mother was ironing and Mrs. van Daan was scheduled for a dental appointment. Dussel began unpacking his case with an air of importance (it was the first time he'd worked on anyone here), and he needed some eau de cologne, which could be used as a disinfectant, and vaseline, which would have to do for wax. Mrs. van D. sat down, and he started looking in her mouth, but every time he touched a tooth, the poor woman flinched and uttered incoherent cries. After a lengthy examination (lengthy as far as Mrs. van D. was concerned, since it actually took no longer than two minutes), Dussel began to scrape out a cavity. But Mrs. van D. had no intention of letting him. She flailed her arms and legs until Dussel finally let go of his probe and . . . it remained stuck in Mrs. van D.'s tooth. That really did it! Mrs. van D. lashed out wildly in all directions, cried (as much as you can with an instrument like that in your mouth), tried to remove it, but only managed to push it in even farther. Mr. Dussel calmly observed the scene, his hands on his hips, while the rest of the audience roared with laughter. Of course, that was very mean of us. If it'd been me, I'm sure I would have yelled even louder. After a great deal of squirming, kicking, screaming and shouting, she finally managed to yank the thing out, and Mr. Dussel calmly went on with his work as if nothing had happened. He was so quick that Mrs. van D. didn't have time to pull any more shenanigans. But then, he had more help than he's ever had before: no fewer than two assistants; Mr. van D. and I performed our job well. The whole scene resembled one of those engravings from the Middle Ages, the kind showing a quack at work. In the meantime, however, the patient was getting restless, since she had to keep an eye on "her" soup and "her" food. One thing is certain: Mrs. van D. will never make another dental appointment!<br><br><b>Sausage Day<br><br>Friday, December 10, 1942<br><br></b>Mr. van Daan had a large amount of meat. Today he wanted to make bratwurst and sausages, and tomorrow mettwurst. It's fun watching him put the meat through the grinder: once, twice, three times. Then he adds all kinds of ingredients to the meat and uses a long pipe, which he attaches to the grinder, to force it into the casings. We ate the bratwurst with sauerkraut (served with onions and potatoes) for lunch, but the sausages were hung to dry over a pole suspended from the ceiling. Everyone who came into the room burst into laughter when they saw those dangling sausages. It was such a comical sight.<br><br>The place was a shambles. Mr. van Daan, clad in his wife's apron and looking fatter than ever, was concentrating his hefty form on the meat. What with his bloody hands, red face and apron, he really looked like a butcher. Mrs. van D. was trying to do everything at once: learn Dutch, cook, watch, sigh, moan--she claims to have broken a rib. That's what happens when you do such stupid physical exercises. Dussel had an eye infection and was sitting next to the stove dabbing his eye with camomile tea. Pim, seated in the sunshine, kept having to move his chair this way and that to stay out of the way. His back must have been bothering him, because he was sitting slightly hunched over with an agonized expression on his face. He reminded me of those aged invalids you see in the poorhouse. Peter was romping around the room with the cat, holding out a piece of meat and then running off with the meat still in his hands. Mother, Margot and I were peeling potatoes. When you get right down to it, none of us were doing our work properly, because we were all so busy watching Mr. van Daan.<br><br><b>The Flea<br><br>Wednesday, July 7, 1943<br><br></b>We're being plagued with yet another problem: Mouschi's fleas. We didn't know that people could be bitten by cat fleas, but they can.<br><br>Yesterday when I was upstairs I found a flea on my leg, ten minutes later when I was downstairs I nabbed another one, and last night when I was sitting on Dussel's bed, I felt another one crawling down my leg, but the little critter slipped through my fingers--they're incredibly fast. This morning I was getting dressed over by the closet when I saw another one of those wondrous creatures, walking along as pretty as you please. A flea that walks as well as jumps is a new experience for me. I picked it up and squeezed as hard as I could, but Mr. Flea hopped away again. Sighing, I got undressed and subjected my naked body and my clothes to a thorough examination until I finally found the flea in my panties. A second later, it was off with his head.<br><br><b>Do You Remember?<br><br>Memories of my schooldays at the Jewish Lyceum<br><br></b>Do you remember? I've spent many a delightful hour talking about school, teachers, adventures and boys. Back when our lives were still normal, everything was so wonderful. That one year of Lyceum was heaven to me: the teachers, the things I learned, the jokes, the prestige, the crushes, the admirers.<br><br>Do you remember? When I came back from town that afternoon and found a package in the mailbox from "un ami, R." It could only have come from Rob Cohen. Inside there was a brooch worth at least two and a half guilders. Ultra-modern. Rob's father sold that kind of stuff. I wore it for two days, and then it broke.<br><br>Do you remember? How Lies and I told on the class. We had a French test. I wasn't having too much trouble with it, but Lies was. She copied my answers and I went over them to make corrections (on her test, I mean). She got a C+ and I got a C-, since thanks to my help she had gotten some things right, but both grades had been crossed out and replaced with a big fat F. Great indignation. We went to Mr. Premsela to explain what had happened, and at the end Lies said, "Yes, but the entire class had their books open under their desks!" Mr. Premsela promised the class that nobody would be punished if all those who had cheated would raise their hands. About ten hands went up--less than half the class, of course. A few days later Mr. Premsela sprang the test on us again. Nobody would talk to Lies and me, and we were branded as snitches. I soon caved in under the pressure and wrote a long letter of apology to Class 1 L II, begging their forgiveness. Two weeks later all had been forgotten.<br><br>The letter went something like this:<br><br>To the students in Class 1 L II,<br><br>Anne Frank and Lies Goslar hereby offer their sincere apologies to the students in Class 1 L II for their cowardly act of betrayal in the matter of the French test.<br><br>However, the deed was done before we had time to think, and we freely admit that we alone should have been punished. We believe that everyone is liable to let a word or sentence slip out in anger from time to time, and this can result in an unpleasant situation, even though it wasn't meant to. We hope that Class 1 L II will see the incident in this light and will repay evil with good. There's nothing more to be gained by it, and the two guilty parties can't undo what's been done.<br><br>We wouldn't be writing this letter if we weren't genuinely sorry for what happened. Furthermore, we ask those of you who have been ignoring us to please stop, since what we did wasn't so bad as to justify being looked upon as criminals for all eternity.<br><br>Anyone who is unable to put this matter behind them should come to us and either give us a good scolding or ask us for a favor, which we will gladly grant, if at all possible.<br><br>We trust that everyone in Class 1 L II will now be able to forget the affair.<br><br>Anne Frank and<br><br>Lies Goslar<br><br>Do you remember? How C.N. told Rob Cohen in the streetcar, within earshot of Sanne Ledermann who passed it on to me, that Anne had a much prettier face than J.R., especially when she smiled. Rob's answer was, "Boy, have you ever got big nostrils, C.!"<br><br>Do you remember? How Maurice Coster was planning to present himself to Pim to ask his permission to see his daughter.<br><br>Do you remember? How Rob Cohen and Anne Frank exchanged a flurry of letters when Rob was in the hospital.<br><br>Do you remember? How Sam Solomon always followed me on his bicycle and wanted to walk arm in arm with me.<br><br>Do you remember? How A.W. kissed me on the cheek when I promised not to tell a soul about E.G. and him.<br><br>I hope that such happy, carefree schooldays will come again.<br><br><b>The Best Little Table<br><br>Tuesday, July 13, 1943<br><br></b>Yesterday afternoon Father gave me permission to ask Dussel whether he would please be so good as to allow me (see how polite I am?) to use the table in our room two afternoons a week, from four to five-thirty. I already sit there every day from two-thirty to four while Dussel takes a nap, but the rest of the time the room and table are off-limits to me. It's impossible to study next door in the afternoon, because there's too much going on. Besides, Father sometimes likes to sit at the desk during the afternoon.<br><br>So it seemed like a reasonable request, and I asked Dussel very politely. What do you think the learned gentleman's reply was? "No." Just plain "No!"<br><br>I was incensed and wasn't about to let myself be put off like that. I asked him the reason for his "No," but this didn't get me anywhere. The gist of his reply was: "I have to study too, you know, and if I can't do that in the afternoons, I won't be able to fit it in at all. I have to finish the task I've set for myself; otherwise there's no point in starting. Besides, you aren't serious about your studies. Mythology--what kind of work is that? Reading and knitting don't count either. I use that table and I'm not going to give it up!"</p><h2>Secret Chicago: A Guide to the Weird, Wonderful, and Obscure</h2><p><p>Embark on a scavenger hunt to the unknown and unusual corners of Chicago.

To this day Romance languages use the expression &#x201c;rich as Croesus&#x201d; to describe a person of excessive wealth. He was said to be visited by Solon, the Greek legislator known for his dignity, reserve, upright morals, humility, frugality, wisdom, intelligence, and courage. Solon did not display the smallest surprise at the wealth and splendor surrounding his host, nor the tiniest admiration for their owner. Croesus was so irked by the manifest lack of impression on the part of this illustrious visitor that he attempted to extract from him some acknowledgment. He asked him if he had known a happier man than him. Solon cited the life of a man who led a noble existence and died while in battle. Prodded for more, he gave similar examples of heroic but terminated lives, until Croesus, irate, asked him point-blank if he was not to be considered the happiest man of all. Solon answered: &#x201c;The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man&#x2019;s happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has [guaranteed] continued happiness until the end we may call happy.&#x201d;<br><br>The modern equivalent has been no less eloquently voiced by the baseball coach Yogi Berra, who seems to have translated Solon&#x2019;s outburst from the pure Attic Greek into no less pure Brooklyn English with &#x201c;it ain&#x2019;t over until it&#x2019;s over,&#x201d; or, in a less dignified manner, with &#x201c;it ain&#x2019;t over until the fat lady sings.&#x201d; In addition, aside from his use of the vernacular, the Yogi Berra quote presents an advantage of being true, while the meeting between Croesus and Solon was one of those historical facts that benefited from the imagination of the chroniclers, as it was chronologically impossible for the two men to have been in the same location.<br><br>Part I is concerned with the degree to which a situation may yet, in the course of time, suffer change. For we can be tricked by situations involving mostly the activities of the goddess Fortuna&#x2014;Jupiter&#x2019;s firstborn daughter. Solon was wise enough to get the following point; that which came with the help of luck could be taken away by luck (and often rapidly and unexpectedly at that). The flipside, which deserves to be considered as well (in fact it is even more of our concern), is that things that come with little help from luck are more resistant to randomness. Solon also had the intuition of a problem that has obsessed science for the past three centuries. It is called the problem of induction. I call it in this book the black swan or the rare event. Solon even understood another linked problem, which I call the skewness issue; it does not matter how frequently something succeeds if failure is too costly to bear.<br><br>Yet the story of Croesus has another twist. Having lost a battle to the redoubtable Persian king Cyrus, he was about to be burned alive when he called Solon&#x2019;s name and shouted (something like) &#x201c;Solon, you were right&#x201d; (again this is legend). Cyrus asked about the nature of such unusual invocations, and he told him about Solon&#x2019;s warning. This impressed Cyrus so much that he decided to spare Croesus&#x2019; life, as he reflected on the possibilities as far as his own fate was concerned. People were thoughtful at that time.<br><br>If You&#x2019;re So Rich, Why Aren&#x2019;t You So Smart?<br><br>An illustration of the effect of randomness on social pecking order and jealousy, through two characters of opposite attitudes. On the concealed rare event. How things in modern life may change rather rapidly, except, perhaps, in dentistry.<br><br>Nero Tulip<br><br>Hit by Lightning<br><br>Nero Tulip became obsessed with trading after witnessing a strange scene one spring day as he was visiting the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. A red convertible Porsche, driven at several times the city speed limit, abruptly stopped in front of the entrance, its tires emitting the sound of pigs being slaughtered. A visibly demented athletic man in his thirties, his face flushed red, emerged and ran up the steps as if he were chased by a tiger. He left the car double-parked, its engine running, provoking an angry fanfare of horns. After a long minute, a bored young man clad in a yellow jacket (yellow was the color reserved for clerks) came down the steps, visibly untroubled by the traffic commotion. He drove the car into the underground parking garage&#x2014;perfunctorily, as if it were his daily chore.<br><br>That day Nero Tulip was hit with what the French call a coup de foudre, a sudden intense (and obsessive) infatuation that strikes like lightning. &#x201c;This is for me!&#x201d; he screamed enthusiastically&#x2014;he could not help comparing the life of a trader to the alternative lives that could present themselves to him. Academia conjured up the image of a silent university office with rude secretaries; business, the image of a quiet office staffed with slow thinkers and semislow thinkers who express themselves in full sentences.<br><br>Temporary Sanity<br><br>Unlike a coup de foudre, the infatuation triggered by the Chicago scene has not left him more than a decade and a half after the incident. For Nero swears that no other lawful profession in our times could be as devoid of boredom as that of the trader. Furthermore, although he has not yet practiced the profession of high-sea piracy, he is now convinced that even that occupation would present more dull moments than that of the trader.<br><br>Nero could best be described as someone who randomly (and abruptly) swings between the deportment and speech manners of a church historian and the verbally abusive intensity of a Chicago pit trader. He can commit hundreds of millions of dollars in a transaction without a blink or a shadow of a second thought, yet agonize between two appetizers on the menu, changing his mind back and forth and wearing out the most patient of waiters.<br><br>Nero holds an undergraduate degree in ancient literature and mathematics from Cambridge University. He enrolled in a Ph.D. program in statistics at the University of Chicago but, after completing the prerequisite coursework, as well as the bulk of his doctoral research, he switched to the philosophy department. He called the switch &#x201c;a moment of temporary sanity,&#x201d; adding to the consternation of his thesis director, who warned him against philosophers and predicted his return back to the fold. He finished writing his thesis in philosophy. But not the Derrida continental style of incomprehensible philosophy (that is, incomprehensible to anyone outside of their ranks, like myself). It was quite the opposite; his thesis was on the methodology of statistical inference in its application to the social sciences. In fact, his thesis was indistinguishable from a thesis in mathematical statistics&#x2014;it was just a bit more thoughtful (and twice as long).<br><br>It is often said that philosophy cannot feed its man&#x2014;but that was not the reason Nero left. He left because philosophy cannot entertain its man. At first, it started looking futile; he recalled his statistics thesis director&#x2019;s warnings. Then, suddenly, it started to look like work. As he became tired of writing papers on some arcane details of his earlier papers, he gave up the academy. The academic debates bored him to tears, particularly when minute points (invisible to the noninitiated) were at stake. Action was what Nero required. The problem, however, was that he selected the academy in the first place in order to kill what he detected was the flatness and tempered submission of employment life.<br><br>After witnessing the scene of the trader chased by a tiger, Nero found a trainee spot on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the large exchange where traders transact by shouting and gesticulating frenetically. There he worked for a prestigious (but eccentric) local, who trained him in the Chicago style, in return for Nero solving his mathematical equations. The energy in the air proved motivating to Nero. He rapidly graduated to the rank of self-employed trader. Then, when he got tired of standing on his feet in the crowd, and straining his vocal cords, he decided to seek employment &#x201c;upstairs,&#x201d; that is, trading from a desk. He moved to the New York area and took a position with an investment house.<br><br>Nero specialized in quantitative financial products, in which he had an early moment of glory, became famous and in demand. Many investment houses in New York and London flashed huge guaranteed bonuses at him. Nero spent a couple of years shuttling between the two cities, attending important &#x201c;meetings&#x201d; and wearing expensive suits. But soon Nero went into hiding; he rapidly pulled back to anonymity&#x2014;the Wall Street stardom track did not quite fit his temperament. To stay a &#x201c;hot trader&#x201d; requires some organizational ambitions and a power hunger that he feels lucky not to possess. He was only in it for the fun&#x2014;and his idea of fun does not include administrative and managerial work. He is susceptible to conference room boredom and is incapable of talking to businessmen, particularly the run-of-the-mill variety. Nero is allergic to the vocabulary of business talk, not just on plain aesthetic grounds. Phrases like &#x201c;game plan,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom line,&#x201d; &#x201c;how to get there from here,&#x201d; &#x201c;we provide our clients with solutions,&#x201d; &#x201c;our mission,&#x201d; and other hackneyed expressions that dominate meetings lack both the precision and the coloration that he prefers to hear. Whether people populate silence with hollow sentences, or if such meetings present any true merit, he does not know; at any rate he did not want to be part of it. Indeed Nero&#x2019;s extensive social life includes almost no businesspeople. But unlike me (I can be extremely humiliating when someone rubs me the wrong way with inelegant pompousness), Nero handles himself with gentle aloofness in these circumstances.</p><h2>30 Days to Taming Your Anger: How to Find Peace When Irritated, Frustrated, or Infuriated</h2><p><p>It's a mad, mad world and rare is the person who gets through a single day without encountering an irritating, frustrating, or anger-producing situation.

Hank, a little animal, finds an egg on the forest floor and tries to return it to the nest overhead. He rolls a log to the tree and steps onto it, but he can&#x2019;t reach the nest. He makes a ladder and climbs up, but the nest is still too high. After sleeping with the egg that night, Hank returns to the tree and sees a hummingbird. Carefully wrapping the egg in moss tied with ribbon, he offers it to the bird, who carries it to her nest. Hank keeps watch nearby until three little hummingbirds hatch and fly to him. Dudley creates and photographs wonderfully detailed, meticulously crafted dioramas. Changing character poses, settings, camera angles, focal points, and lighting contribute to the illustrations&#x2019; unusually strong sense of reality. This unassuming story holds great appeal for young children, who frequently find themselves too small to accomplish what they set out to do. Hank prevails through his creativity, his persistence, and his ability to work with another to solve a problem. A quietly magical little book to share, one on one, with a small child.

Or is it a Victorian novel in the guise of a time-traveling tale, or a highly comic romp, or a great, allusive literary game, complete with spry references to Dorothy L. Sayers, Wilkie Collins, and Arthur Conan Doyle? Its title is the subtitle of Jerome K. Jerome's singular, and hilarious, <i>Three Men in a Boat</i>. In one scene the hero, Ned Henry, and his friends come upon Jerome, two men, and the dog Montmorency in--you guessed it--a boat. Jerome will later immortalize Ned's fumbling. (Or, more accurately, Jerome will <i>earlier</i> immortalize Ned's fumbling, because Ned is from the 21st century and Jerome from the 19th.) <p> What Connie Willis soon makes clear is that genre can go to the dogs. <i>To Say Nothing of the Dog</i> is a fine, and fun, romance--an amused examination of conceptions and misconceptions about other eras, other people. When we first meet Ned, in 1940, he and five other time jumpers are searching bombed-out Coventry Cathedral for the bishop's bird stump, an object about which neither he nor the reader will be clear for hundreds of pages. All he knows is that if they don't find it, the powerful Lady Schrapnell will keep sending them back in time, again and again and again. Once he's been whisked through the rather quaint Net back to the Oxford future, Ned is in a state of super time-lag. (Willis is happily unconcerned with futuristic <i>vraisemblance</i>, though Ned makes some obligatory references to "vids," "interactives," and "headrigs.") The only way Ned can get the necessary two weeks' R and R is to perform one more drop and recuperate in the past, away from Lady Schrapnell. Once he returns something to someone (he's too exhausted to understand what or to whom) on June 7, 1888, he's free. </p><p> Willis <i>is</i> concerned, however, as is her confused character, with getting Victoriana right, and Ned makes a good amateur anthropologist--entering one crowded room, he realizes that "the reason Victorian society was so restricted and repressed was that it was impossible to move without knocking something over." Though he's still not sure what he's supposed to bring back, various of his confederates keep popping back to set him to rights. <i>To Say Nothing of the Dog</i> is a shaggy-dog tale complete with a preternaturally quiet, time-traveling cat, Princess Arjumand, who might well be the cause of some serious temporal incongruities--for even a mouser might change the course of European history. In the end, readers might well be more interested in Ned's romance with a fellow historian than in the bishop's bird stump, and who will not rejoice in their first Net kiss, which lasts 169 years!</p>Praise for Connie Willis's Hugo and Nebula Award-Winning <i>Doomsday Book:</i><p>"A tour de force." <br><i>--The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"... stunning...the best work yet from one of science fiction's best writers."<br><i>--The Denver Post</i></p><p>A Publishers Weekly Best Book of 1997:<br>"Displaying the skills that have won her more major SF awards than any other writer of the decade, Willis juggles comedy of manners, hard science theory and a host of literary references in this sophisticated dazzlement."<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"An utter delight.

Given all the hype, it&#x2019;s hard to choose from among the staggering array of bottled beverages, yet beyond all the advertising is a clear liquid that can restore your health. In Healing Waters, Dr. Ben Johnson guides you to oxygen-rich ionized water--a substance that has been proven to maximize well-being.</p> <p><strong><i>Healing Waters</i></strong> begins by explaining why water is crucial to good health. It then explores the importance of the body&#x2019;s acid-alkaline balance and examines why problems with this balance are responsible for many chronic diseases. Finally, the author presents everything you need to know about ionized water, including what it is, why it is necessary to wellness, and how you can produce it. While the Fountain of Youth may be just another legend, with <i><strong>Healing Waters</strong>,</i> you will understand that a good source of health and longevity may be no farther than your own home.&nbsp;</p></p><p>Ben Johnson, MD, DO, NMD, earned his doctorate in osteopathy from the University of Health Sciences in Kansas City, and went on to obtain both a medical degree and a doctorate in naturopathic medicine. He was featured in the international bestseller<i> The Secret. <br></i>&nbsp;<p>Imagine if one of nature&#x2019;s most powerful healers was available to you twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Imagine if the answer to many of your most pressing health problems could be found in your own home. Though it may sound too good to be true, this is not a farfetched fantasy--it&#x2019;s a reality, and it&#x2019;s in your kitchen.</p> <p>Water is the most abundant substance on earth, the primary source of life, and a liquid you consume in some form every day. It&#x2019;s in most of the foods you eat, it&#x2019;s the base for nearly every beverage you drink, and it&#x2019;s contained in every breath of air you inhale. So it&#x2019;s astonishing that so many medical conditions on the rise today stem from chronic dehydration--insufficient water intake over an extended period of time. From fatigue to premature aging, from asthma to inflammation, and from dry skin to diabetes, the body&#x2019;s need for more water often lies at the root of the problem. And although health professionals have touted the importance of proper hydration for several years, urging us to fit in our eight glasses daily, these problems remain. Why? Because when it comes to water&#x2019;s impact on your body, <i>quality </i>is just as important as <i>quantity</i>, especially for the prevention and treatment of disease. Meeting your daily water requirement is part of the battle, but the environmental toxins in tap water and our modern, highly acidic diet can counteract the numerous benefits offered by a glass of pure H-2-O.</p> <p>There&#x2019;s a way out of this dilemma. The solution is ionized water, which, for decades, has been used in other countries as a means of improving health. Superior to both distilled and filtered water, ionized water is H-2-O that has undergone a mild--and safe--electrolyzing process that boosts its vitality, rids it of harmful, acidifying chemicals, and makes it capable of transporting nutrients and oxygen all over your body quickly and effectively. Moreover, technological advances have made it possible for this scientific process to take place in your own home, which means that it can easily become part of your lifestyle and daily routine.</p> <p>As a physician for more than thirty years, it has been my mission to spread the word about medical innovations that I have employed in my practice and found to work with my patients. Ionized water is one such innovation, and this book sets out to demystify the ionized water phenomenon, explaining the science behind the process of ionization as well as how it works to enhance practically every function your body carries out. Chapters 1 and 2 lay the groundwork for this investigation, beginning with a discussion of the health benefits of water in general and why the vast majority of Americans are suffering from the damaging effects of chronic dehydration. Chapter 2 is an informative guide to acid-alkaline balance, a major factor in maintaining good health. Acid-alkaline <i>imbalance </i>is connected to a wide variety of serious medical problems, and understanding this connection is one key to understanding the special power of ionized water.</p> <p>Chapter 3 takes a closer look at ionized water and its distinctive characteristics. You&#x2019;ll learn about its chemical makeup and how it came to be used for medicinal purposes. In this chapter you will also discover how electrolysis improves the quality of drinking water more than distillation or filtration. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 cover the wide expanse of health benefits offered by both alkaline and acidic ionized water, from enhanced oxygenation of the body to radiant skin. You will find how ionized water can be used to prevent premature aging, alleviate allergies, and treat diabetes, among other health conditions.</p> <p>The final two chapters of this book are geared towards you, the reader, and give some guidelines for not only making ionized water a part of your everyday life, but also maximizing its benefits. Chapter 7 provides some dietary recommendations and food-combining tips for achieving acid-alkaline balance. Foods and beverages have been categorized according to their acidifying or alkalizing effects, which will help you make dietary choices that will reinforce ionized water&#x2019;s healing function. Chapter 8 is a helpful guide to buying and using a water ionizer, an investment that will surely change the way you live for the better. You can also consult the &#x201c;Resources&#x201d; section at the end of the book to find ionizer manufacturers and distributors located in the United States.</p> <p>Simply put, ionized water is nature&#x2019;s water. Reading this book is the first step towards total rejuvenation of your body and overall health. If you want to enrich the quality of your health and life naturally, safely, easily, and in the comforts of your own home, then read on.</p></p><h2>The Light of Venus: Embracing Your Deeper Feminine, Empowering Our Shared Future</h2><p>The Light of Venus offers a complete system of tracking with and understanding the cycle of Venus in our skies.

Alban Berg referred to the first movement of the Ninth Symphony as "the most glorious [Mahler] ever wrote," and further observed, "the whole movement is based on a premonition of death which constantly recurs ... that is why the tenderest passages are followed by tremendous climaxes like new eruptions of a volcano."<br>Now the full orchestral score of the Ninth Symphony is available in the inexpensive, high-quality edition, reprinted from an authoritative Viennese score. Music lovers and admirers of Mahler's work will find in these pages abundant evidence of the fresh and formidable thinking the composer brought to this monumental composition.</p><p></p></p><p>Austrian composer and conductor Gustav Mahler (1860&#x2013;1911) wrote chiefly symphonies and <i>Lieder. </i>Late Romantic in style, his tempestuous works reflect the anxious mood of Europe at the turn of the 20th century. Because of his Jewish roots, the composer's&nbsp;music was suppressed by the Nazis but has enjoyed a steady revival over the past five decades.</p><h2>Electra and Other Plays: Euripides (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>Euripides, wrote Aristotle, &#x2018;is the most intensely tragic of all the poets&#x2019;. In his questioning attitude to traditional pieties, disconcerting shifts of sympathy, disturbingly eloquent evil characters and acute insight into destructive passion, he is also the most strikingly modern of ancient authors.</b><p>Written in the period from 426 to 415 BC, during the fierce struggle for supremacy between Athens and Sparta, these five plays are haunted by the horrors of war &#x2013; and its particular impact on women. Only the <b>Suppliants</b>, with its extended debate on democracy and monarchy, can be seen as a patriotic piece. <b>The Trojan Women</b> is perhaps the greatest of all anti-war dramas; <b>Andromache</b> shows the ferocious clash between the wife and concubine of Achilles&#x2019; son Neoptolemos; while <b>Hecabe</b> reveals how hatred can drive a victim to an appalling act of cruelty. <b>Electra</b> develops (and parodies) Aeschylus&#x2019; treatment of the same story, in which the heroine and her brother Orestes commit matricide to avenge their father Agamemnon. As always, Euripides presents the heroic figures of mythology as recognizable, often very fallible, human beings. Some of his greatest achievements appear in this volume.</p></p><p><b>Euripides</b>, the youngest of the three great Athenian playwrights, was born around 485 BC of a family of good standing. He first competed in the dramatic festivals in 455 BC, coming only third; his record of success in the tragic competitions is lower than that of either Aeschylus or Sophocles. There is a tradition that he was unpopular, even a recluse; we are told that he composed poetry in a cave by the sea, near Salamis. What is clear from contemporary evidence, however, is that audiences were fascinated by his innovative and often disturbing dramas. His work was controversial already in his lifetime, and he himself was regarded as a &#x2018;clever&#x2019; poet, associated with philosophers and other intellectuals. Towards the end of his life he went to live at the court of Archelaus, king of Macedon. It was during his time there that he wrote what many consider his greates work, the <b>Bacchae</b>. When news of his death reached Athens in early 406 BC, Sophocles appeared publicly in mourning for him. Euripides is thought to have written about ninety-two plays, of which seventeen tragedies and one satyr-play known to be his survive; the other play which is attributed to him, the <b>Rhesus</b>, may in fact be by a later hand.<br><p>John Davie is head of classics at St. Paul's School in London.</p><br><p>Richard Rutherford is tutor in Greek and Latin literature at Christ Church, Oxford.</p><br><p>Richard Rutherford is tutor in Greek and Latin literature at Christ Church, Oxford.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Greek</p><h2>Space Cat Visits Venus</h2><p>"This easy science fiction book continues the same kind of humor and adventure of the author's first book, <i>Space Cat</i>.

Caesar&#x2019;s jealous enemies masquerade as friends and scheme to oust the autocrat from power and restore true republican government to Rome.

She is the bestselling author of numerous novels, including <i>The Thorn Birds</i>, and lives with her husband on Norfolk Island in the South Pacific.<b>Introduction</b><br><br>The Ides of October marked the end of the campaigning season, and on that day a race was held on the grassy sward of the Campus Martius, just outside the Servian Walls of Republican Rome. <br><br>The year's best war horses were harnessed in pairs to chariots and driven at breakneck pace; the right-hand one of the winning pair became the October Horse, and was ritually killed with a spear by the <i>flamen Martialis,</i> the special priest of Mars, who was god of war. Then the October Horse's head and genitalia were amputated. The genitals were rushed to bleed on the sacred hearth in the Regia, Rome's oldest temple, after which they were given to the Vestal Virgins to burn to ashes in the sacred flame of Vesta; later these ashes were mixed into cakes offered on the anniversary of the founding of Rome by her first king, Romulus. The decorated head was tossed into the midst of two teams of humble citizens, one from the Subura district, one from the Sacra Via district, who fought strenuously for possession of it. If the Subura won, the head was nailed to the Turris Mamilia. If the Sacra Via won, the head was nailed to an outer wall of the Regia. <br><br>In this ritual so old that no one remembered how it had begun, the very best that Rome owned was sacrificed to the twin powers that ruled her: war and land. Out of them came her might, her prosperity, her everlasting glory. The death of the October Horse was at once a mourning of the past and a vision of the future. <br><br>Copyright � 2002 by Colleen McCullough</p><h2>The World Crisis: The Complete Set (Bloomsbury Revelations)</h2><p><p><i>The World Crisis</i> is considered by many to be Winston S.

Born in 1773, he trained in medicine at Edinburgh, then served for some years as a surgeon&#x2019;s assistant in a Fifeshire regiment. There he put his spare time to worthy use. Rising early, he taught himself German (nouns and their declensions before breakfast, his diary records, conjugation of auxiliary verbs afterward) so that he could master the considerable German literature on botany, his chosen subject. On a visit to London in 1798, the young Scotsman met and so impressed the great botanist Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society, that on Banks&#x2019;s recommendation he sailed three years later on a long voyage to Australia, returning in 1805 with close to four thousand exotic plant specimens neatly stowed on his ship. These he spent the next several years assiduously describing, classifying, and cataloging, serving meanwhile as Banks&#x2019;s librarian and personal assistant. Brown&#x2019;s remarkable Australian trove, along with Banks&#x2019;s own equally notable collection, became the heart of the botanical department of the British Museum, of which Brown became the first professional curator. He was, said a visitor to Banks&#x2019;s London house, &#x201c;a <i>walking catalogue</i> of every book in the world.&#x201d;<br><br>Charles Darwin, before he was married, passed many a Sunday with the learned Robert Brown. In his autobiography Darwin describes a contradictory man, vastly knowledgeable but powerfully inclined to pedantry, generous in some ways, crabbed and suspicious in others. &#x201c;He seemed to me to be chiefly remarkable for the minuteness of his observations and their perfect accuracy. He never propounded to me any large scientific views in biology,&#x201d; Darwin writes. &#x201c;He poured out his knowledge to me in the most unreserved manner, yet was strangely jealous on some points.&#x201d; Brown was notorious, Darwin adds, for refusing to lend out specimens from his vast collection, even specimens that no one else possessed and which he knew he would never make any use of himself.<br><br>It is ironic, then, that this dry, cautious man should be commemorated now mainly as the observer of a curious phenomenon, Brownian motion, that represented the capricious intrusion of randomness and unpredictability into the elegant mansion of Victorian science. It was indeed the very scrupulousness of Brown&#x2019;s observations that made the implications of Brownian motion so grave.<br><br>In June 1827, Brown began a study of pollen grains from <i>Clarkia pulchella</i>, a wildflower, popular today with gardeners, that had been discovered in Idaho in 1806 by Meriwether Lewis but named by him for his co&#x2013;explorer William Clark. Characteristically, he intended to scrutinize minutely the shape and size of pollen particles, hoping that this would shed light on their function and on the way they interacted with other parts of the plant to fulfill their reproductive role.<br><br>Brown had acquired a microscope of recent and improved design. Its compound lenses largely banished the rainbow&#x2013;hued fringes of color that afflicted the borders of objects seen in more primitive instruments. Under Brown&#x2019;s eye the ghostly shapes of the pollen grains sprang clearly into view, their edges neatly delineated. Even so, the images were not perfect. The pollen grains wouldn&#x2019;t stay still. They moved about, jiggled endlessly this way and that; they shimmered and stuttered; they drifted with strange erratic grace across the microscope&#x2019;s field of view.<br><br>This incessant motion complicated Brown&#x2019;s planned investigations, but it was not so very surprising. More than a century and a half earlier Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a draper from Delft, Holland, had astonished and delighted the scientific world when he described tiny &#x201c;animalcules&#x201d; of strange and myriad form that his crude microscope revealed in droplets of pond water, in scrapings from the unbrushed teeth of old men, and even in a suspension of ordinary household pepper crushed into plain water. &#x201c;The motion of most of these animalcules in the water was so swift, and so various, upwards, downwards, and round about, that &#x2019;twas wonderful to see,&#x201d; the entranced Leeuwenhoek wrote. His discovery not only spurred further scientific investigation but also led well&#x2013;to&#x2013;do citizens to purchase microscopes for their parlors and drawing rooms, where they could amaze their guests with this new wonder of nature.<br><br>Some animalcules had tiny hairs or finny extensions that enabled them to swim about. Others wriggled like little eels. It was easy to imagine that their meanderings were purposeful in some rudimentary way. Pollen grains, on the other hand, were simple in shape and had no moving parts. Still, they were undeniably organic. It seemed to Brown not unreasonable to suppose that pollen grains&#x2014;especially as they were the male parts of a plant&#x2019;s reproductive equipment&#x2014;might possess some vital spirit that impelled them to move in their amusing but inscrutable fashion.<br><br>But Brown distrusted vague hypotheses of this sort. Observation, not speculation, was his forte. Testing pollen from other plants, he found that those grains danced about too. But then he examined minute fragments of leaves and stems and saw that those also jogged perplexingly about under his microscope&#x2019;s gaze.<br><br>His attention caught by this &#x201c;very unexpected fact of seeming vitality,&#x201d; Brown could not help but probe the matter further. He obtained dust from dried plant samples, some more than a century old. He scraped tiny fragments from a piece of petrified wood. All these tiny grains had once been living but were now long dead, any vital spark extinguished. Examined under a microscope, they also shimmied. He moved on to truly inorganic material, knocking tiny shards from a variety of rocks and a piece of ordinary window glass. They too jiggled about. To put the case to the ultimate test, he scratched powder from a piece of the Sphinx, to which, as a curator of the British Museum, he had easy access and which he presumably regarded as certifiably, unarguably dead, on account of its provenance.<br><br>Placed in a drop of water under his microscope lens, ancient dust from the Sphinx danced about like everything else.<br><br>Brown acknowledged that he was not the first to see things jiggling about under the microscope. A certain Mr. Bywater of Liverpool, he noted, had a few years earlier looked at fragments of both organic and inorganic materials and observed &#x201c;the animated and irritable particles&#x201d; that they all shed. But Brown, through a variety of ingenious and careful experiments, established that the ceaseless motion of all these tiny fragments was neither the &#x201c;animalcular motion&#x201d; Leeuwenhoek and others had seen nor movement produced by vibration or turbulence of the fluid suspensions, by the action of heat, or through electric or magnetic influences.<br><br>This was contradictory and baffling. Dead particles of dust clearly couldn&#x2019;t move of their own volition, nor was any external influence pushing them around. Yet move they all too plainly did. Brown himself made no attempt at an explanation. He was a careful descriptive botanist, not a philosopher of nature, and as Charles Darwin said, &#x201c;much died with him, owing to his excessive fear of never making a mistake.&#x201d;<br><br>Faced with this impossible dilemma, science took the prudent course and ignored Brownian motion for decades. Its deep significance went unnoticed because the phenomenon was so far beyond scientific apprehension. There was no way even to begin to grasp what it meant. Anyone who used a microscope knew about Brownian motion, at least as a great nuisance, but few read carefully what Brown himself had said about it. Most botanists and zoologists persisted in the idea that it was a manifestation of vital spirits, conveniently ignoring Brown&#x2019;s demonstration that inert particles jiggled about just as much. Or else they decided their specimens were buffeted by heat or vibrations or electrical disturbances, ignoring Brown's experiments that ruled out those and other influences.<br><br>It was not until after Brown's death in 1858 that a few scientists began to see their way to an understanding of the phenomenon. As often happens in science, the observations could not be understood until there was at least the glimmering of a theory by which to understand them. The theory in this case was not a new idea but a very old one that science finally had the means to make sense of.<br><br>The Greek thinker Democritus, who flourished around 400 B.C, believed that all matter was made of tiny, fundamental particles called atoms (from the Greek <i>atomos</i>, indivisible). No matter how prescient this notion seems in retrospect, it was really a philosophical conceit more than a scientific hypothesis. What atoms were, what they looked like, how they behaved, how they interacted&#x2014;such things could only be guessed at. Modern interest in atoms revived first among the chemists. In 1803, John Dalton in England proposed that rules of proportion in chemical reactions&#x2014;hydrogen and oxygen combining in a fixed ratio to produce water, for example&#x2014;came about because atoms of chemical substances joined together according to simple numerical rules.<br><br>Atoms didn&#x2019;t gain credibility overnight. As late as 1860 an international conference convened in Karlsruhe, Germany, to debate the atomic hypothesis. The weight of opinion by now favored atoms, but there was significant dissent. Many distinguished chemists were happy to take laws of chemical combination as basic rules in their own right, and saw no reason to indulge in extravagant speculation about invisible particles.<br><br>August Kekul�, the German chemist who famously devised the ring structure of the benzene molecule while dozing in his fireside armchair and dreaming about snakes catching their own tails, offered a more shaded opinion. He accepted the existence of the chemical atom, along the lines suggested by Dalton and others, and he noted that some physicists, for their own reasons, had also recently begun arguing for atoms. But were the chemist&#x2019;s atom and the physicist&#x2019;s atom the same thing? Kekul� thought not, or at least that any such judgment was premature.<br><br>To the chemist, an atom was a thing of almost tactile qualities. It possessed in some way the characteristics of the substance it represented, and it could hook up with or detach from other atoms, according to their respective qualities. Chemists mostly imagined that atoms in bulk sat still, filling space like oranges in a crate.<br><br>Physicists thought quite differently. Their atoms were tiny, hard pellets, flying about at high speed in mostly empty space, occasionally crashing into each other and bouncing off again. The role of these atoms was specific. Beginning about halfway through the nineteenth century, a number of mathematically inclined physicists began to pursue the idea that the frenetic motion of atoms could explain the hitherto mysterious phenomenon of heat. As atoms in a volume of gas gained energy, they would fly about faster, bump into each other more violently, and crash more forcefully into the walls of a container. This was why gas would expand when heated, and exert more pressure. In this so&#x2013;called kinetic theory of heat, heat was nothing but the energy of atomic motion. The deeper implication was that large&#x2013;scale physics of heat and gases ought to follow ineluctably from the small&#x2013;scale behavior of atoms as they moved and collided in strict obedience to Newton&#x2019;s laws of motion.<br><br>Thus arose the reliable cliche of the atom as a tiny billiard ball, hard but inert, banging mindlessly about. Whether this had anything to do with chemistry was another question. Physicists allowed that the atoms of one gas might be lighter or heavier than those of another, but why gases had distinct chemical properties was none of their business.<br><br>The atom, in short, was in these early days by no means a unifying hypothesis. If chemists and physicists had little to say to each other, still further excluded were the microscopists and biologists. Kinetic theory came with mathematical complexities that repelled all but a select few, while the typical mathematician, if even aware of Brownian motion, most likely assumed it was a trivial phenomenon of strictly botanical interest.<br><br>Nevertheless, a connection awaited discovery. A first hint came from Ludwig Christian Wiener, who spent most of his life teaching mathematics and geometry at German universities. In 1863, after conducting experiments that confirmed everything Brown had long ago found, Wiener felt able to publish an intriguing if speculative suggestion. If the liquid in which Brownian particles jiggle about was in reality a welter of furious atoms, then these atoms would buffet the suspended particles from all sides. The erratic but incessant agitation of the invisible atoms, he argued, would cause the larger visible particles to stagger unpredictably about.<br><br>In keeping with the tangled history of this subject, Wiener's daring proposal attracted next to no interest.<br><br>It fell to a series of French and Belgian Jesuit priests to keep digging for a scientific account of Brownian motion. During the nineteenth century many clergymen maintained an active and useful interest in the observational and collecting sciences: botany, geology, zoology, and so on. The clerical connection comes up in <i>Middlemarch</i>, when the determinedly atheistic man of science Dr. Lydgate visits the agreeably untheological Reverend Farebrother and finds that the clergyman has an impressive natural history collection, including specimens, books, and journals. Happy to encounter a fellow philosopher of nature, Lydgate offers to show Farebrother a few of his own items, in particular &#x201c;Brown&#x2019;s new thing&#x2014;<i>Microscopic Observations on the Pollen of Plants</i>&#x2014;if you don't happen to have it already.&#x201d;<br><br>What&#x2019;s more, Jesuits and many other churchmen had a surprisingly broad and rigorous education in philosophy, logic, and even mathematics. Such men were singularly well equipped to deal with problems that we might now call cross&#x2013;disciplinary but which in those days were merely part of the broad enterprise called science. Mathematical physicists, by contrast, were by the latter half of the nineteenth century on their way to becoming a breed apart, inhabitants of their own recondite discipline, a realm that even those with an adequate amateur command of mathematics were increasingly shy of entering.<br><br>This growing divide meant that by the end of the 1870s, a number of scientists perceived the correct qualitative explanation of Brownian motion but lacked the means to put their hypothesis into convincingly quantitative terms. It&#x2019;s strangely difficult to find anyone willing to take credit for seeing the answer. In an 1877 issue of the London <i>Monthly Microscopical Journa</i>l, for example, we find Father Joseph Delsaulx, S.J., attributing to an unnamed colleague the suggestion that Brownian motion results from the constant agitation of small particles by the atoms or molecules that make up a liquid. (Chemists had by this time established the distinction between atoms, which were fundamental, and molecules, which were combinations of atoms.)<br><br>Three years later, writing for the <i>Revue des Questions Scientifiques</i>, Father J. Thirion, S.J., mentions that he had seen some years before a similar proposal jotted down in the unpublished laboratory notes (!) of &#x201c;Fr. Carbonelle, a <i>savant</i> well known to our readers, to whom another of our colleagues, Fr. Renard, had shown for the first time the curious movement of <i>libelles</i>.&#x201d; These <i>libelles</i>, Thirion is helpful enough to explain, are microscopic dark spots seen within little pockets of liquid trapped in samples of qua...</p><h2>Way Of The Wiseguy</h2><p>Now in paperback, here's the first nonfiction work from Joe Pistone since his <i>New York Times</i> #1 bestseller and hit movie, <i>Donnie Brasco</i>. Perhaps no man alive knows the lifestyle of wiseguys better than Pistone does, having spent six years infiltrating the Mafia as an undercover FBI agent. Now, years later, Pistone reassesses the underworld. Often poignant, and in startling detail, THE WAY OF THE WISEGUY gives readers a first-hand look at the psychology and customs of the wiseguy.The book features 34 chapters that reveal key principles of wiseguy life, including How Wiseguys Carry Out a Hit,&#x201d; How Wiseguys Get Straightened Out,&#x201d; and A Typical Day in the Life of a Wiseguy.&#x201d; Pistone's spellbinding stories provide a first-hand look at this lawless realm of badguys, which is often uncannily relevant to the workings of legitimate big business and everyday social discourse.</p><p>Joseph D. Pistone is the legendary FBI Special Agent who put his life on the line to infiltrate the U.S. Mafia for six years, resulting in the convictions of over 200 mobsters. He lives in an undisclosed location.The romanticized view of the mob gets a reality check in this fascinating guide to the real Cosa Nostra from Pistone, who successfully infiltrated one of New York City's five families as an FBI undercover agent in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During his six years posing as Donnie Brasco, Pistone managed to gain the trust of countless mobsters and was almost formally made a member of the Mafia. That access led to numerous investigations and prosecutions resulting in more than 100 convictions, including those of the bosses who formed the mob's ruling body, the Commission. Pistone's first book, the bestselling <i>Donnie Brasco</i> (later filmed with Johnny Depp in the lead role), presented a detailed chronological narrative of his infiltration. This time, he has organized his experiences into short chapters describing what the gangsters he worked with were really like, with titles such as "A Typical Day in the Life of a Wiseguy" and "How Wiseguys Take over a Business." He makes abundantly clear that the codes of honor depicted in popular culture and self-serving Mafiosi memoirs are myths, as is the notion that the old-timers steered clear of drug-dealing for moral reasons. The book also contains an amazing extra-a CD of an actual FBI surveillance tape in which thugs talk about the idea of doing in Donnie Brasco. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

One of the major poets of the twentieth century, Amichai created remarkably accessible poems, vivid in their evocation of the Israeli landscape and historical predicament, yet universally resonant. His are some of the most moving love poems written in any language in the past two generations&#x2015;some exuberant, some powerfully erotic, many suffused with sadness over separation that casts its shadow on love. In a country torn by armed conflict, these poems poignantly assert the preciousness of private experience, cherished under the repeated threats of violence and death.</p><p> Amichai&#x2019;s poetry has attracted a variety of gifted English translators on both sides of the Atlantic from the 1960s to the present.

Prior to the establishment of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the work of great women artists had been ignored, forgotten, or denied; they had been largely left out of museums and histories of art.<br> <br>Founded in 1987 by Wilhelmina Cole Holladay in Washington, D.C., the National Museum of Women in the Arts boasts a growing membership that is among the top ten in the world. The museum's multifaceted treasures include paintings, sculpture, photographs, prints, and crafts produced over the past five centuries by an international array of women artists.<br> <br>Included here, in full color, are works by Lavinia Fontana, Judith Leyster, Elisabeth-Louise Vig�e-Lebrun, Hester Bateman, Rosa Bonheur, Berthe Morisot, Mary Cassatt, Camille Claudel, Berenice Abbott, Maria Montoya Martinez, Frida Kahlo, Georgia O'Keeffe, Lee Krasner, and many more.<br></p><p>Susan Fisher Sterling is the director of The National Museum of Women in the ArtsExcerpt from: <b> <i>Women Artists</i> </b> <br> <br>Introduction<br> <br>Women have created art since the earliest time. In the ancient world the Greeks celebrated the artworks of Asirtarete, Eirene, Kalypso and Thamyris. Iaia of Cyzincus, who lived in Rome around 100 B.C., was famed as a painter and engraver of ivories whose portraits were valued beyond price.<br> <br>During the Middle Ages the women of the church, from Saint Hilda of England (610-680) to Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179), achieved renown for their learning, piety, and power. In the great abbeys they penned Latin verse, composed devotional music, and created illuminated manuscripts, vestments and other precious objects for both Church and state. Noblewomen, too, gained fame for their achievements as embroiderers and fine artisans. The Bayeux tapestry&#x2014;the famous depiction of William the Conqueror's victory at the Battle of Hastings in 1066&#x2014;is but one of many works created by women of the medieval court. Scores of ancient and medieval women remain unknown, and in many instances it may be true that "Anonymous" was a woman.<br> <br>This volume of works from the National Museum of Women in the Arts (NMWA)&#x2014;the only museum in the world dedicated to recognizing the achievements of women artists&#x2014;is a record of women's accomplishments from the Renaissance to the present. Paging through the collection, one experiences a revised history of art. Many of the artists represented in this Tiny Folio (TM) may not be known to you, and you will be tempted to ask why you have never heard of them. The answers to that question have much to do with how women have been viewed and valued throughout the history of Western society.<br> <br>In 1893, at the opening of the magnificent Woman's Building at the World's Columbian Exposition, Mrs. Potter Palmer and her board of lady managers expressed the hope that their greatly prized, if temporary, building&#x2014;dedicated to art, education, home, charity, science, and every branch of human endeavor&#x2014;would spur the creation of a permanent Woman's Memorial Building. Although this was not meant to be, one hundred years later that dream has been realized with the National Museum of Women in the Arts. The museum has the unique mission of bringing "recognition to the achievements of women artists of all periods and nationalities by exhibiting, preserving, acquiring, and researching art by women and by educating the public concerning their achievements." NWMA fulfills this mandate by maintaining and displaying a permanent collection, presenting special exhibitions and performances, conducting educational programs, supporting a library and research center, and serving a network of national and international chapters.<br> <br>The National Museum of Women in the Arts became a reality through the dedication of Wilhelmina Cole Holladay, wit the help of countless individuals and organizations throughout the country. As collectors, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay and Wallace F. Holladay began to focus on art by women during the 1960s, when scholars were just beginning to uncover rich and varied aspects of that cultural heritage, From the 1960s though the mid&#x2013;1980s the Holladays assembled a core collection of more that three hundred significant works by women artists.<br> <br>In 1981 the National Museum of Women in the Arts was incorporated as a private, nonprofit institution. At the beginning it was a "museum without walls," offering docent&#x2013;led tours of the collection at the Holladay residence. Then, in 1983, the museum purchased the landmark building&#x2014;formerly the Masonic Temple of the Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia&#x2014;a few blocks from the White House in Washington. After four years of renovation, the museum opened to the public in 1987. THe groundbreaking inaugural exhibition American Women Artists, 1830&#x2013;1930, demonstrated the contributions that women from Sarah Miriam Peale to Georgia O'Keeffe had made to the history of American art. It was at this time that the Holladays presented the majority of their collection as a seed donation to the museum. Many of the works from this core collection are reproduced within pages of this volume.<br> <br>Just one year earlier, in 1986, women artists had been included for the very first time in H. W. Janson's History of Art, the standard textbook that has been used by generations of art history students. Women had at least been made part of the canon, although still in very small numbers: of the twenty&#x2013;three hundred artists discussed in that massive tome, only nineteen were women. Conditions have improved since then, strengthened in part by the presence of NMWA, along with the burgeoning of feminist scholarship, greater opportunities for contemporary women artists in the marketplace, and a higher concentration of female professors and curators. Earlier artists such as Mary Cassatt, Camille Claudel, Frida Kahlo, and Georgia O'Keeffe have been the subject of major retrospectives, here and elsewhere. Contemporary artists&#x2014;among them, Helen Frankenthaler, Nan Goldin, Elizabeth Murray, and Bridget Riley&#x2014;have received significant attention as well. Women artists were formerly given exhibitions only late in life or posthumously, but now public recognition tends to come earlier. Still, there is much to be done.<br> <br>Since its opening, the National Museum of Women in the Arts has acquired important works of art by Sofonisba Anguissola, Judith Leyster, Elizabeth Louis Vig�e&#x2013;Lebrun, K�the Kollwitz, Frida Kahlo, Louise Dahl-Wolfe, Louise Nevelson, Judy Chicago, Magdalena Abakanowicz, and many others; it has also received collections of Georgian silver by British silversmiths, miniatures on ivory by Eulabee Dix, engravings by Grace Albee, and Letters and papers by Frida Kahlo. The collection now comprises more than four thousand paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, sculptures, artists' books, ceramics, and other decorative objects. The museum also houses a Library and Research Center well known for its resources on women in the arts, including materials on more than eighteen thousand women artists. Much of this archival information is available online through the Clara Database of Women Artists�. As the museum has grown, so has the range of its activities. Public programs for youth and adults highlights the work of women in a variety of creative disciplines. NMWA also serves students and teachers locally and nationally through its tours, outreach, and online educational resources such as Art, Books, and Creativity curriculum.<br> <br>Noteworthy as well is the museum's grassroots support. Since its inauguration, more than 225,000 people have joined NMWA, Making it one of the largest museums in the United States in terms of membership. In response to this outpouring of interest, the museum has established a network of national and international chapters, whose purpose is to offer community&#x2013;level educational events, research programs, and exhibitions, and to assist in the accumulation of resource materials for the library and research center. there are currently more than twenty chapters, with several more in formation.<br> <br>The National Museum of Women in the Arts strives to integrate women into the historical mainstream of artistic achievement and to the foster the visibility of contemporary women artists working in diverse disciplines. The more we know about the art of women from all times, the greater the legacy will be for future generations to cherish.<br></p><h2>The New Chic: French Style From Today&#39;s Leading Interior Designers</h2><p><b>The next generation of Parisian interior designers curated by the editors of <i>French Architectural Digest</i>.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> From Vincent Darr� and Joseph Dirand to India Mahdavi, a new wave of design talent has emerged in Paris.

From the advent of photography in the 19th and into the 20th century, medical students, often in secrecy, took photographs of themselves with the cadavers that they dissected: their first patients. Featuring 138 of these historic photographs and illuminating essays by two experts on the subject, <i>Dissection</i> reveals a startling piece of American history. Sherwin Nuland, MD, said this is "a truly unique and important book [that] documents a period in medical education in a way that is matched by no other existing contribution." And <b>Mary Roach said Dissection "is the most extraordinary book I have ever seen--the perfect coffee table book for all the households where I'd most like to be invited for coffee."</b><br></p><p>This is a startling window into the education of American doctors in the late 19th and early 20th centuries-on both a visceral level and for its revealing cultural record. Cringe-worthy shots of medical students-bare-handed gentlemen and a few ladies in street clothes show off their scalpels, saws and textbooks-while their cadavers, mostly poor and black, are awkwardly posed, and exposed. In one stunning shot, a black woman looks out from behind the young students. "What are we to make of an African-American woman, standing, broom handle in hand, behind the dissection table, her gaze fixed on the camera?" the authors ask. More importantly, they conclude, the photo is now drawn "out of the shadows of history" where "we can at least bear witness." A blood-soaked dissection table makes you want to look away and the dark humor of students playing pranks with skeletons are both hilarious and horrible. Postcards sent to family and friends must have caused shock and awe for postmen and recipient alike. Here, a difficult glance into medicine's "uncomfortable past" offers a grand opportunity to understand the legacy doctors and patients live with, and benefit from, today. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The legendary Connie Mack, who saw quite a few cards during his nearly seven decade stint in the majors, once observed that no other screwball he ever saw could hold a candle to Rube. Mack also said that Rube&#39;s curveball was the best he&#39;d ever seen. Indeed, Waddell was one of the greatest pitchers in the history of the game. Rube won 191 games in 13 seasons, had four straight 20-win seasons for Mack and the Philadelphia A&#39;s, and claimed six consecutive strikeout titles. In 1904 he struck out 349 batters, a record that held for six decades.

We feel her deep hunger while she sits&nbsp;<i>zazen&nbsp;</i>in a monastery in Japan, and her profound loss when she hears of the passing of a dear friend while teaching in the French countryside.<br><br>Through it all, she remains grounded in a life informed by two constants: the practices of writing and of Zen.

How about a Scandinavian smorgasbord, tomatillo salsa with arbol chiles, Nepali green chile chutney, Ethiopian beef tartar, or Yemeni stew?&#34;Two people caught in the grip of wanderlust&#34;, as Alford and Duguid describe themselves, this Canadian pair has traveled for nearly two decades, singly and together, throughout Asia, Europe, the Mediterranean, North Africa, and North America. As they have pursued their passions for travel photography and culinary research, they have found around the world a shared and nourishing element of culture and cuisine: flatbreads, the simplest, oldest, and most marvelously varied form of bread known to humankind. Immersing themselves in local cultures - from the Malaysian island of Penang and the high Himalayan passes of Tibet to the market stalls of Provence and the pueblos of New Mexico - Alford and Duguid have studied bread baking and cooking with local bakers, in family kitchens, with street vendors, and at neighborhood restaurants and cafes. In Flatbreads and Flavors they share more than sixty recipes for flatbreads of every origin and description: tortillas from Mexico, pita from the Middle East, naan from Afghanistan, chapatti from India, pizza from Italy, and French fougasse. As well, within each of the eight regional chapters of the book, they provide 150 exuberant recipes for traditional accompaniments to the breads. These include chutneys and curries, salsas and stews, rich samplings of the Mediterranean mezze table and the Scandinavian smorgasbord, and such delectable pairings as Chinese Spicy Cumin Kebabs wrapped in Uighur nan or Lentils with Garlic, Onion, and Tomato spooned onto chapatti. Oven-baked, grilled, fried, skillet-baked, steamed, or even baked beneath the desert sand, flatbreads are a fascinating, satisfying, and simple form that brings wholesome grains into our diet.They can be made from every grain imaginable: wheat, rye, corn, oats, millet, sorghum, teff, rice, buckwheat. They can be unleavened or leavened. They can be made so thin that they become transparent, or they can be two inches thick and sliceable. But Flatbreads and Flavors is not only a book about the original life-sustaining food served around the world since time began, it is also a book about people and places, with vivid images and shared experiences captured in brief prose essays and in Alford and Duguid&#39;s own acclaimed photographs. Redolent with the tastes and aromas of the world&#39;s hearths, it maps a course through cultures old and intriguing. With clear and patient recipes and special sections defining techniques, ingredients, and equipment, Flatbreads and Flavors makes accessible to the novice and experienced baker alike the simple and satisfying bread baker&#39;s art.</p><h2>Mezzanines</h2><p><p>"There&#x2019;s something inherently spiritual about Olzmann&#x2019;s <i>Mezzanines</i>. . . .

Gaventa pays careful attention to Luke&#39;s story of God, as well as to the numerous characters who set themselves in opposition to God&#39;s plan.</p><p>Beverly Roberts Gaventa is Helen H. P.

Wilson includes an introduction that tells the story of Lao Tzu, the "old man" and the "keeper of the archives," and wonderful notes to illuminate the text. He also includes two short essays--one explains the relationship between Taoism and Zen, and the other explores the roots that link the spiritual aspects of the Tao with the practice of Chinese and Japanese martial arts. Wilson's version of this ancient classic is wonderfully fresh and readable.</p><p><p>A Timeless Philosophy on Personal Success</p><p>One of the true classics of international literature, the Tao Te Ching is still a source of inspiration and guidance for millions. The oldest scripture of Taoism, its focus on attunement, rather than mindless striving, offers an alternative to commence-and-control leadership and a different way to seeing and achieving personal success.</p><p>This keepsake edition includes and introduction by Tom Butler-Bowdon, drawing out lessons for the contemporary reader, showing how the Tao Te Ching remains vital reading for anyone seeking to win without conflict, and to achieve a balanced and productive life.</p>WILLIAM SCOTT WILSON is the foremost translator into English of traditional Japanese texts on samurai culture. He received BA degrees from Dartmouth College and the Monterey Institute of Foreign Studies, and an MA in Japanese literary studies from the University of Washington.

His classic novella&nbsp;<i>The Old Man and the Sea&nbsp;</i>won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died in 1961.&#34;Reconciling literature and action, he fulfilled for all writers, the sickroom dream of leaving the desk for the arena, and then returning to the desk. He wrote good and lived good, and both activities were the same.&#34; -- Anthony Burgess</p><h2>D.Gray-man, Vol. 24 (24)</h2><p>Set in a fictional 19th century England, D.Gray-man is the story of Allen Walker, a 15-year-old boy who roams the earth in search of Innocence.

Getz provide a thorough overview of modern empires and colonialism from the late fifteenth century to the present. Synthesizing the vast outpouring of new scholarship that examines empires in a global context, the book pays as much attention to the Ottoman, Mughal, Ming, and Qing Empires as to European colonialism, and stresses the continuous social, political, and cultural interactions between colonizers and colonized. <br><br>Amply illustrated with photographs and full-color maps, <em>Empires and Colonies in the Modern World</em> examines numerous issues--including commodity flows, pan-movements, and anti-colonial activism--that superseded the boundaries of colonies and empires entirely. It calls attention not only to the complexities of the internal dynamics of individual empires, but also to the constant interactions between empires, and between colonies with different national metropoles.<br></p><p><br><strong>Heather Streets-Salter </strong>is History Department Chair and Director of World History Programs at Northeastern University.<br><br><strong>Trevor R. Getz</strong> is Professor of African History and World History at San Francisco State University.<br><br>"In this wide-ranging, ambitious, and highly readable book, Heather Streets-Slater and Trevor Getz make the case for the interdependence of empires and the global from the Mongols through the Iraq war. They skillfully navigate basic definitions, complex processes, and scholarly arguments based on the latest research to support their argument that global empires were totalizing experiences--historically specific yet marking out a distinctive era in world history. Readers will come away not just with a deeper understanding of what the underpinnings of modern imperialism and colonialism are, but with a greater appreciation of what a global perspective on these developments means as well."--Antoinette Burton, <em>University of Illinois</em><br><p></p><br>"Heather Streets-Salter and Trevor Getz have written a major overview of modern empires and colonialism that covers the last five-hundred years and that brilliantly summarizes the outpouring of new work placing empires in a global context. Paying as much attention to the Ottoman, Mughal, Ming, and Qing Empires as to European colonialism, the work stresses the continuous interaction between colonizer and colonized and is as attentive to gender and identity issues as it is to conquest, collaboration, and resistance. A must read for global historians interested in empires. The footnotes and the bibliography are treasures in themselves."--Robert Tignor, <em>Princeton University</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"At long last we have a truly comprehensive and comparative study of global empires from the early modern era until the twenty-first century. The authors are to be commended for their unfailingly lucid presentation of the entangled processes, in multiple scales and in many places, which ultimately forged the world that we inhabit today. Empires and Colonies represents both an invaluable classroom text and a rich compendium for scholars."--Julia Clancy-Smith, <em>University of Arizona</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Relating Narratives: Storytelling and Selfhood (Warwick Studies in European Philosophy)</h2><p>A major new work by the philosopher and feminist thinker Adriana Cavarero, this is a fascinating and challenging account of the relationship between the structure of the self and the structure of narrative.</p><p>Adriana Cavarero is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Verona and Visiting Professor at New York University. She is the author of <i>In Spite of Plato</i> (1995), published by Routledge.<strong>'This is an important book, not least for the fruitful ways in which it brings two dominant modes of cognition in the West, philosophy and narrative, face to face with each other. And perhaps even more important for its joyous and antinomian rejection of what narrative has brought us, in interiority and all its burdens.'</strong> - <em>Radical Philosophy</em></p><h2>Greatness: Who Makes History and Why</h2><p>What do Madonna, Confucius, and Jackie Robinson have in common? What does it take to go down in history as a great political leader? Why do revolutions occur, riots break out, and lynch mobs assemble? Which events do people find the most shocking or memorable?<br><br>This path-breaking work offers the first comprehensive examination of the important personalities and events that have influenced the course of history. It discusses whether people who go down in history are different from the rest of us; whether specific personality traits predispose certain people to become world leaders, movie stars, scientific geniuses, and athletes, while others are relegated to ordinary lives. In exploring the psychology of greatness, this volume sheds light on the characteristics that any of us may share with history-making people.<br><br>Throughout, the book addresses two broad questions: what sorts of people are responsible for historic events and achievements, and what kinds of events are most likely to be seen as history-making at their time of occurrence. Providing a wealth of examples, the text probes the lives of important figures, from charismatic political and military leaders to famous writers, Nobel Prize winners, child prodigies, and Olympic athletes. The book covers history-making events such as international crises, technological innovations and scientific breakthroughs, popular TV shows, natural disasters, and many more.<br><br>With unerring insight, Simonton examines the full range of phenomena associated with greatness--everything from genetic inheritance, intuition, aesthetic appreciation, and birth order, to formal education, sexual orientation, aging, IQ, and alcohol and drug abuse. The work embeds psychological topics in the larger contexts of science, art, politics, and history to essentially define a new interdisciplinary field of study: the psychology of history.<br><br>Written in an engaging style, and offering the first in-depth examination of a topic with universal appeal, GREATNESS will be welcomed by everyone interested in the people and events that have made the world what it is today.<br><br></p><p>In this path-breaking work, Dean Keith Simonton examines a range of important personalities and events that have influenced the course of history.

After nearly two-dozen printings in two editions and the garnering of hundreds of undergraduate classroom adoptions, the latest edition of <i>Thunder</i> includes valuable updates of reservation life and the author s fictive family members at Mescalero.<p> The compelling four-day and four-night Mescalero Apache girls puberty ceremonial remains the backdrop of Farrer s interpretive, introductory discussion of time and the mythic present. The oral traditions and instructions given to Farrer by the late Bernard Second, her longtime Apache teacher, provide insight into the importance of narrative not just in ceremonials but also in daily life.</p><p> Farrer neither romanticizes nor patronizes the Apachean people, who are presented as people with foibles as well as possessing much worthy of admiration. The Third Edition incorporates a fully developed concluding chapter Returning and furnishes thoughtful, end-of-chapter questions to prompt readers to explore their own reactions to the text.</p><p> Title of related interest from Waveland Press: Basso, <i>The Cibecue Apache</i> (ISBN 9780881332148).</p><p> Visit waveland.com for a complete list of modern and classic ethnographies on Apache, Comanche, Crow, Navajo, Papago, Pueblo, Shoshone, Sioux, and other American Indian cultures.</p></p><p>Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Basso, <i>The Cibecue Apache</i> (ISBN 9780881332148); and Hultkrantz, <i>Native Religions of North America: The Power of Visions and Fertility</i> (ISBN 9780881339857)."Farrer's latest book crystallizes her previous work into its most powerful form to date. . . . It comes as a surprise to recognize, after finishing it, how much deep knowledge it has imparted and how cleverly it is constructed. It creates the ambience for the reader to enter the Apache mythic present." -- <i>Anthropology and Humanism</i> <p>"Foremost among the volume's many strengths is its engaging, highly readable, reflexive writing style. Descriptions of sights, smells, sounds, and colors are vivid, and the people come alive." -- <i>American Anthropologist</i> </p><p>"<i>Thunder Rides a Black Horse</i> is an excellent ethnography that makes the Mescalero Apache come to life and the author, Claire R. Farrer, a real person. The final chapter when she returns to a people she has worked with for 40 years not only brings the reader up to date but also introduces a new set of problems that confront their tribe. There is no sense of being `stuck in the past,' only a historical depth that takes the people into the future. Highly recommended for cultural anthropology classes and Native American courses." -- Robert McPherson, <i>College of Eastern Utah</i></p></p><h2>The Genogram Casebook: A Clinical Companion to Genograms: Assessment and Intervention</h2><p><p><strong>A long-awaited workbook companion to Monica McGoldrick&#x2019;s highly successful textbook Genograms.</strong></p> This clinical companion to the bestselling <em>Genograms: Assessment &amp; Intervention</em> uses case examples to articulate the most effective ways to use genograms in clinical practice.<br><br> Widely utilized by family therapists and health care professionals, the genogram is a graphic way of organizing the mass of information gathered during a family assessment and finding patterns in the family system for more targeted treatment. For a client with cutoff relationships or a history of trauma, it can be hard to talk to a therapist about past and present relationships. Genograms are a non-intrusive and non-confrontational way to learn about a client's history and chart crucial, complex information for effective assessment and therapy.<br><br><em>The Genogram Casebook</em> deploys richly detailed case examples to address resistance to genograms, overcoming dysfunctional relationship patterns, working with couples, navigating issues of divorce and remarriage, using genograms in family sessions with children, repairing conflict and cutoff with family members, looking at the therapist's own family, and much more. It's a vibrantly practical, decisively essential guide to the use of genograms in mental health practice.</p><p>Monica McGoldrick, M.A., M.S.W., Ph.D., is co-founder and director of the Multicultural Family Institute in Highland Park, New Jersey, and adjunct faculty at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.

But sometimes it's better to be unconventional. In <em>Rethinking Rubrics in Writing Assessment</em>, Maja Wilson offers a new perspective on rubrics and argues for a better, more responsive way to think about assessing writers' progress. </p> <p> Though you may sense a disconnect between student-centered teaching and rubric-based assessment, you may still use rubrics for convenience or for want of better alternatives. <em>Rethinking Rubrics in Writing Assessment</em> gives you the impetus to make a change, demonstrating how rubrics can hurt kids and replace professional decision making with an inauthentic pigeonholing that stamps standardization onto a notably nonstandard process. With an emphasis on thoughtful planning and teaching, Wilson shows you how to reconsider writing assessment so that it aligns more closely with high-quality instruction and avoids the potentially damaging effects of rubrics. </p> <p> Stop listening to the conventional wisdom, and turn instead to a compelling new voice to find out why rubrics are often replaceable.

It provides intuitive examples from real data sets. I think it is a great resource for teaching students how to carry their own research projects." -- Sabri Ciftci<br><br>"This is a great workbook to teach Stata to students who are also learning the basics of statistical analysis. It comes with four datasets that can be used to run analyses. Its exercises are very useful and the instructor tools are great." -- Tijen Demirel-Pegg<br><br>"For teaching Stata to undergraduates, this book provides the friendliest approach I have found. Over six straight semesters of teaching the same course, I have found it to make both my teaching experience and the students&#x2019; learning experience far more interesting and interactive than a typical "Research Methods" course. It provides exceptional instructional assistance, and presents information to students in an easily digestible way." -- Lilliana Mason, Rutgers</p><h2>Forum: Lectiones Latinitatis Vivae / Speaking Latin as a Living Language (Latin Edition)</h2><p><p>The goal of <em>Forum</em> is to enable students to speak Latin as a living language. Studies have shown that unless one speaks, reading fluency becomes difficult to attain. Because it teaches students to speak Latin, <em>Forum</em> prepares them to read without the use of dictionary or translation, and to read as fluently as one might read in any modern language.</p><p><em>Forum </em>applies to Latin the teaching methods commonly used for modern language acquisition: total oral immersion, total physical response (TPR), role-playing games, gradual complexity of dialogues and stories, and gradual grammatical progression.</p><p>Whether used by students on their own or by an instructor with a group, this first-level book submerges the student within the language. The audio files that are available for free download on the Polis Institute website will help the student to internalize grammatical forms and vocabulary. As only the Latin language is heard by the students using these files, they are unable to rely on an intermediary language and are thus compelled to employ the new skills they have acquired through this text.</p><p><em>Forum </em>teaches Classical Latin in the broadest sense. The classical period includes the golden age of Latin literature (1st c. BC &#x2013; 1st c. AD) as well as the Imperial Latin from the Nerva-Antonine dynasty (96-192 AD) and the Severan dynasty (193-235 AD). This period has the advantage of being an intermediate between pre-Classical Latin and Late Latin (3rd c.-6th c. AD). Even authors from the 4th or 5th centuries AD such as St. Augustine of Hippo or St. Jerome, albeit writing in a slightly different language than the classical one, took the golden age of Latin literature as a reference. Studying Classical Latin (in the broad sense) allows us to easily read the most interesting Latin texts of Antiquity and the Middle Ages.</p></p><p></p><h2>Understanding Civil Procedure (Understanding Series)</h2><p>This well-established treatise is premised on the assumption that the key to understanding the principles of civil procedure is to know why: why the principles were created and why they are invoked. The treatise is written to answer these questions as it lays out the basic principles of civil procedure. It also reflects the authors&#39; belief that students of civil procedure can understand and appreciate complex principles when they are clearly presented; teaching civil procedure does not require dumbing it down. The authors use the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as a model, but they also refer to different state rules and doctrines where appropriate in order to present a representative cross-section of state models. Although they discuss important civil procedure cases in the text, thus supporting the most widely used civil procedure casebooks using these same cases, they also provide useful references to secondary sources and illustrative cases for the reader who wants to explore further. Finally, they also treat thoroughly the most recent developments in personal jurisdiction and electronic discovery, with special attention to the latest rule changes affecting such discovery. The resulting treatise is sophisticated, clear, and current, equally accessible and useful to students and practitioners.</p><p>Gene Shreve is an Emeritus Professor of Law at Indiana University at Bloomington School of Law.

Employee disengagement and customer fickleness remain high, resulting in a lack of creativity and collaboration at all levels of entrepreneurial activity. Investor demand for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) continues to be poorly integrated into profit strategies.</p> <p>Drawing on extensive research, this book shows how changing a person's consciousness is the most powerful lever for unlocking his or her leadership potential to create wealth and serve humankind. A wide range of practices of connectedness provide the keys. The journey to higher consciousness changes people at a deep intuitive level, combining embodied experience with analytic-cognitive skill development. Tsao and Laszlo show how leaders who pursue this journey are more likely to flourish with significant benefits to both business and society. These include greater creativity and collaboration along with an increased capability to inspire people and produce lasting change. Readers will come away with a deep understanding of quantum leadership and the day-to-day practices that can help them achieve greater effectiveness and wellbeing at work.</p></p><p><b>Frederick Chavalit Tsao</b> is the Chairman of IMC Pan Asia Alliance Group and founder of Octave.

Sometimes these moments are decades apart, and sometimes they are millennia distant. Tsao and Laszlo have created one of these moments for you. This book will not only enlighten you, it will bend your mind in space and time. When we are in sync within ourselves (our bodies, mind, and spirit), when we are in tune with others around us and our natural environment, we are one. As an individual and in our human groups, when we are in sync we function at our peak in innovation, creativity, and compassion, and expand our possibilities.

The principles behind effective quantum devices are a perfect match with the principles of tuning and evolving individual consciousness. Tsao and Laszlo take this all one step further to unveil how to apply the principles of oneness, wholeness, discovery, and evolution to awaken extraordinary leadership for corporations, nations, and species. This knowledge is accurate, timely, and critical. Integrate it and pass it on!" (Foster Gamble <i>Producer, <i>Thrive</i></i>)<br><br>"If we are to survive and flourish on this planet, we will need to transform ourselves at our most basic spiritual levels, becoming partners with each other in creating a world that works for everyone with no one left out.

Tsao and Laszlo's <i>Quantum Leadership</i> offers us a powerful vehicle for seeing and acting on the possibilities for our transformation as spiritual beings &#x2013; becoming leaders at all levels of our lives and in our organizations and societies.

Stoner Chair for Global Sustainability <i>Fordham University</i>)<br><br>"We now live in an age in which the latest science is describing a world that seems unfamiliar to our everyday classical experience: As we are, so the world appears. Business leaders who harness the science of connectedness presented in this book will be poised to function at a higher level of creativity, productivity, and profitability while transforming the world around them in a way that typical corporate social responsibility initiatives cannot mimic. Kudos to the authors for presenting a complete how-to framework for business that places the heart of transformation right where it should be: within you." (Dr. Anoop Kumar <i>MD, author of <i>Michelangelo's Medicine: How Redefining the Human Body Will Transform Health and Healthcare</i></i>)<br><br>"We have long known &#x2013; but have seldom openly discussed &#x2013; that the world's most successful business and civic leaders have tapped into a 'non-material toolkit' that places intuition and gut-feel on par with other essential management tools. Accessing information and inspiration from our deeper levels of consciousness not only can improve our organization's outcomes, but can catalyze new approaches, products, and services that serve the greater good&#x2015;leading to a triple win for the organization, its stakeholders, and society as a whole. The time is now for this important work by Tsao and Laszlo!"

Beginning with the invention of writing in the ancient world, the author explores a wide range of magical beliefs and practices, the rise of the witch trials, and the depiction of the Devil-worshipping witch. <br><br>The book also covers the more recent history of witchcraft and magic, from the Enlightenment to the present, exploring the rise of modern magic, the anthropology of magic around the globe, and finally the cinematic portrayal of witches and magicians, from <em>The Wizard of Oz </em>to<em> Charmed</em>, <em>Buffy the</em> <em>Vampire Slayer</em>, and <em>Harry Potter</em>.<br></p><p><br><strong>Owen Davies</strong> is Professor of Social History at the University of Hertfordshire.

Consequently, illustrations are used as references to the imaginaries embedded in the sometimes-overlapping social climates and cultural differences. In fact, these illustrations complete an already greatly refined and up-to-date history of witches and sorcerers one that pertains to every discipline in the humanities and social sciences concerned with issues of power and alterity."--<em>Reading Religion</em><p></p><br>"As per usual for the series, this volume is thorough in its coverage.

This book helps you learn the C language with a unique method that goes beyond syntax and how-to manuals and helps you understand how to be a great programmer. You'll learn key areas such as language basics, pointers and pointer arithmetic, and dynamic memory management, and with advanced topics such as multi-threading and network programming, <i>Head First C</i> can be used as an accessible text book for a college-level course.<br>Also, like a college course, the book features labs: projects intended to stretch your abilities, test your new skills, and build confidence. You'll go beyond the basics of the language and learn how to use the compiler, the make tool and the archiver to tackle real-world problems.<br>We think your time is too valuable to waste struggling with new concepts. Using the latest research in cognitive science and learning theory to craft a multi-sensory learning experience, <i>Head First C</i> uses a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works, not a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep.</p><p><br> <p><b>Author Interview with David &amp; Dawn Griffiths</b></p> <p><b>What made you write the book?</b></p> <p>There are already great C books, but many of them are pretty hard for a new developer to understand. Many of the existing books were written several years ago when people were still focused on memory and chips and assembly language. That's not the case any more and we felt that the world was ready for a modern introduction to C.</p> <br> <p><b>Why is your book especially important now?</b></p> <p>Because C is still hugely popular. Tiobe currently list C as the second most popular language after Java; langpop.com list it as the most popular language in the world. In the last few years, the number of platforms has increased dramatically. People don't just use desktop Windows machines any more. There are tablets, phones, and even custom Arduino devices. People are hacking Linux. Makers are building things to do who-knows-what and all of these platforms have one thing in common: they have applications written in C, or use languages that are based on C. The first thing that normally happens when a new platform is created is someone builds a C compiler for it. This book teaches people how to make the most of that.</p> <br> <p><b>What is the single most important thing readers will be able to do after reading your book?</b></p> <p>Head First C takes you deeply into how memory and pointers work and how to avoid the pitfalls. That sounds like a small thing, and for most languages memory-use is not a big issue. But things like memory-pointers are a huge stumbling block for new C programmers. We teach the ways that array variables are like pointer variables, and the ways that they are very different. We take you on a journey through the stack and the heap. Show you how literals work. We even show you how to use advanced tools like valgrind to track down and fix memory problems in your code. In a fundamental way, if you understand how C uses memory, then you understand C.</p> <br> <p><b>Who is your intended audience?</b></p> <p>Really anybody who's new to C, whether they're writing Linux code, or programming Arduino. But our primary audience is college students who are building their first C projects. C is popular in colleges because it's such a foundational subject. But if you're suddenly thrust into an introductory C course and you start to have problems with the code, where do you go? </p> <br> <p><b>What do you think is on the horizon for your readers?</b></p> <p>C is important because it gives you a much more fundamental understanding of how the computer works. If you really understand C, you will be more equipped to learn other languages. If you know C, you can become a better Java programmer. If you learn C, you will have a better understanding of how Python works. Once you learn C, you have the foundations in place to, say, program games in C++, or write code in Objective C that will make the most of the hardware on the iPhone or iPad. Or to enter the world of open source development on Linux. C is an entry point to a whole other level of development.</p><p>David Griffiths began programming at age 12, after being inspired by a documentary on the work of Seymour Papert.

Witness this famous image from the 1989 Tiananmen protests in Beijing&#x2014;the one of the single man who, the morning after the violent crackdown on the protesters began, simply stood in the road in front of a column of tanks on their way down Chang&#x2019;an Avenue into Tiananmen Square, and refused to move. In the picture, he is holding two shopping bags; he looks as if he were simply going about his day when he happened upon the tanks and suddenly decided, I&#x2019;ll block them. Both the BBC and CNN having been able to film the event, we know that when the lead tank tried to go around the man, he stepped into its path again&#x2014;and then again and again, in a dance that in the videos seems almost cartoon-like. In truth, there was nothing playful about it. There was gunfire everywhere; these tanks were on a murderous mission. Still, when the lead tank finally stopped and, with all the rest of the column behind it, turned off its engine, the man climbed up onto its turret, called into a porthole, and spoke to a soldier. Then, later, when the tanks turned their engines back on and tried to move again, he leapt down and began blocking them once more&#x2014;back and forth, back and forth&#x2014;until he was finally pulled away. To this day, we do not know who pulled him. Nor do we know, sadly, what happened to this man. But all in all, it was a most heart-stopping confrontation. Indeed, it was one of the most riveting confrontations of the twentieth century, and his actions were without question transcendently brave. Were they, though, the actions of an interdependent self?<br><br>Many in the West would say no. Many would say that these actions represented the opposite of collectivism&#x2014;that they were the actions of a true individualist, staying true to his avocado pit and standing up to an oppressive society. But that just goes to show how individualists filter the world. Though interdependent flexi-selves are more like members of a baseball team than they are art-for-art&#x2019;s-sake artists, they are as capable of heroic action as any big pit self. Individualists have absolutely no monopoly on courage or initiative.<br><br>Strikingly interdependent was the moment when the man climbed up onto the tank and spoke to the soldier inside. That blurring of a boundary&#x2014;in this case, between him and the tank&#x2014;is, as we shall see, a hallmark of the flexi-self, and was interestingly the focus of some of the early coverage of the event. In fact, the first picture of the incident, circulated by Reuters and run for at least six hours in many newspapers worldwide, was a photo of the man up on the tank&#x2019;s hull.<br><br>It was only later coverage that settled on the more individualistic picture&#x2014;the iconic image of the man facing down the lead tank through which many of us could see what we wanted to see. For, perhaps a bit short and slight for the job, and somehow not wearing a holster or carrying a gun, the man in front of the tank nonetheless conjures up John Wayne. This is a man who fairly emanates the power of a single, courageous, authentic consciousness. He is standing up for freedom, as he must, we imagine, for there is something in him he cannot deny, something extraordinary; and in this he is like, say, Marshal Will Kane of the movie High Noon or lawyer Atticus Finch in the novel To Kill a Mockingbird, or any real genius or artist. Is it possible that he is just an ordinary man who wishes the soldiers would not fire on their fellow Chinese? And is it possible that he sees the soldiers as ordinary, too&#x2014;as mere humans gone wrong, which is why he is knocking on their hatch? Well, no. We don&#x2019;t see that.<br><br>That he may well be just such a man, though, is suggested by a study of two murderers done by researchers Michael Morris and Kaiping Peng. In comparing the U.S. coverage of two mass murders&#x2014;one involving a Chinese physics student named Gang Lu and one involving an Irish American postal worker named Thomas McIlvane, both of which occurred in the autumn of 1991&#x2014;they found significant differences between the leading English-language paper, The New York Times, and the leading Chinese-language paper, the World Journal. &#x201c;American reporters attributed more to personal dispositions and Chinese reporters attributed more to situational factors,&#x201d; they wrote. By this they meant that the English-language reporters ascribed Gang Lu&#x2019;s actions to his avocado pit. &#x201c;He had a very bad temper,&#x201d; they said. He was a &#x201c;darkly disturbed man who drove himself to success and destruction.&#x201d; He had &#x201c;psychosocial problems with being challenged.&#x201d; And, &#x201c;There was a sinister edge to Mr. Lu&#x2019;s character well before the shootings.&#x201d; In short, &#x201c;whatever went wrong was internal.&#x201d; In contrast, the Chinese-language reporters said nothing about Lu&#x2019;s essential character, but rather blamed the things in his context that might have influenced him&#x2014;his relationships and circumstances: He &#x201c;did not get along with his advisor,&#x201d; they wrote. He was in a &#x201c;rivalry with the slain student.&#x201d; He &#x201c;was a victim of the &#x2018;Top Students&#x2019; Education Policy.&#x2019; &#x201d; The incident &#x201c;can be traced to the availability of guns.&#x201d;<br><br>This pattern was the same for the Thomas McIlvane case. The English-language reporters emphasized McIlvane&#x2019;s personal characteristics: He &#x201c;was mentally unstable,&#x201d; &#x201c;had repeatedly threatened violence,&#x201d; and &#x201c;had a short fuse.&#x201d; The Chinese-language reporters emphasized his circumstances: He &#x201c;had recently been fired.&#x201d; The &#x201c;post office supervisor was his enemy.&#x201d; He was inspired by the &#x201c;example of a recent mass slaying in Texas.&#x201d; And so on.<br><br>This conception of people as being shaped by their situations, as opposed to having sole control of their destinies, was echoed in a 2014 New Yorker article about a doctor stabbed to death by a patient named Li Mengnan in the northern Chinese city of Harbin. The doctor was not even treating Li; he was simply the first person Li saw when he walked in, frustrated and enraged by other events. And we should note that, horrendously as Li had in truth been treated, the doctor&#x2019;s father did not feel the abuse excused Li&#x2019;s actions. During the trial, the doctor&#x2019;s father refused to accept Li&#x2019;s apology: &#x201c;Those words were not from the bottom of his heart,&#x201d; he said. Li was eventually sentenced to life in prison. Later, though, when the New Yorker writer, Christopher Beam, asked the doctor&#x2019;s father whom he blamed for his son&#x2019;s death, the father answered, &#x201c;I blame the health-care system . . . Li Mengnan was just a representative of this conflict. Incidents like this have happened many times. How could we just blame Li?&#x201d;<br><br>Other cultures favor a situational model of responsibility as well. For example, in a comparative study of Israeli and American long-term unemployed, MIT Sloan School psychologist Ofer Sharone found that while Americans blamed themselves for their predicament, Israelis blamed the system. This did make the Israelis feel like commodities&#x2014;that was the bad news. But the good news was that applying for jobs did not involve a referendum on their deepest selves. They were not particularly anxious about their self presentation, starting with their resumes. As one job hunter put it, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like the tablets on Mount Sinai. It&#x2019;s the product specs.&#x201d; Neither did they see the interview as about chemistry or like a date; and as for what ultimately happened, &#x201c;These are idiotic situations that are determining your fate,&#x201d; they said&#x2014;frustrating, yes, but not a reason to think, as did so many Americans, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with me?&#x201d;<br><br>Similarly, in a Peruvian school play about Little Red Riding Hood, the Big Bad Wolf was not simply big and bad. He was hungry, having fallen on hard times. And in a version I once saw in a Chinese elementary school, the Wolf was later remorseful&#x2014;so much so that he regurgitated Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother. The play ended with everyone&#x2014;including the Wolf&#x2014;holding hands and dancing in a circle.<br><br>Did the man in the Tiananmen tank picture similarly conceive of the soldiers as driven by circumstance rather than as bad guys? We cannot know, of course. But here&#x2019;s the question: Given the way we Westerners edit the world, does it even occur to us that he might have?<br><br>For another example, take the self-portrait of a Chinese scholar on the next page. Exhibited in New York by the Asia Society, an organization dedicated to educating the world about Asia, this Self-Portrait in Red Landscape was painted by Xiang Shengmo in 1644, at the fall of the Ming Dynasty, a most traumatic time. The government having been overthrown by the foreign Manchus, many literati were simply distraught&#x2014;among them, this painter, who expressed his deep grief by painting himself in black but his surroundings in red. This was a reference to the name of the Ming imperial family, which had meant &#x201c;vermilion red,&#x201d; and that this was a subversive act is clear from the fact that after its painting, the work was quickly hidden away, and not taken out again until the fall of the Manchus in 1911.<br><br>At the same time, we can see from all the inscriptions on the painting that the work as a whole is finally as much about community as it is about resistance: The central image is, after all, surrounded by the sympathetic writings of other Ming loyalists. Yet in 2013, when the Asia Society had a New York Times ad made out of the painting, the inscriptions were cropped out. As we can see in in an ad on the following page, the narrative of the work is presented as more individualistic than it actually is&#x2014;a version, in fact, of the individual-versus-society narrative in the iconic Tiananmen tank photo. Once again we have the lone dissenter that dominates Western culture&#x2014;the Thomas More who stands up to Henry VIII and his craven court in A Man for All Seasons, the Winston Smith who stands up to Big Brother in George Orwell&#x2019;s 1984.<br><br>Can we blame an organization like the Asia Society for Westernizing the image? Their goal was to get people to visit their show, after all, and to do that they had to appeal to the readers of The New York Times&#x2014;people likely to find the cropped image more compelling than the original. Of course, if these readers visited the show, they would then be confronted with images and narratives that challenged their worldview. But first they had to be gotten in the door&#x2014;or so we might guess.<br><br>Here, in any case, is a third example of editing for which we have a clearer window into the decision-making. This example involves the writer Annie Dillard, who in 1974 published a riveting memoir called Pilgrim at Tinker Creek. Her book won the Pulitzer Prize and dazzled a whole generation, yours truly among them, thanks to passages like this:<br><br>At the time of Lewis and Clark, setting the prairies on fire was a well-known signal that meant, &#x201c;Come down to the water.&#x201d; It was an extravagant gesture, but we can&#x2019;t do less. If the landscape reveals one certainty, it is that the extravagant gesture is the very stuff of creation. After the one extravagant gesture of creation in the first place, the universe has continued to deal exclusively in extravagances, flinging intricacies and colossi down aeons of emptiness, heaping profusions on profligacies with ever-fresh vigor. The whole show has been on fire from the word go. I come down to the water to cool my eyes. But everywhere I look I see fire; that which isn&#x2019;t flint is tinder, and the whole world sparks and flames.<br><br>The writing is brilliant, ecstatic, visionary. Our hair stands on end. Sentence after sentence leaps from the page, sparking and flaming itself. And it does seem that in some ideal world their sheer quality should have been enough to make this a watershed book.<br><br>But Dillard was not at all sure that the world would take her&#x2014;a &#x201c;Virginia housewife named Annie,&#x201d; as she called herself&#x2014;seriously. And so Pilgrim styles itself as a kind of Walden with Dillard a kind of Thoreau even though, as Atlantic writer Diana Saverin points out, Dillard wasn&#x2019;t &#x201c;living alone in the wild. In fact, she wasn&#x2019;t even living alone. She was residing in an ordinary house with her husband&#x2014;her former college poetry professor.&#x201d; What&#x2019;s more, Dillard had written a thesis on Thoreau and knew perfectly well that stories of lone men in the wilderness often involved some hooey. &#x201c;In Wildness is the preservation of the World,&#x201d; Thoreau wrote in his 1862 essay &#x201c;Walking,&#x201d; for example. Yet as Saverin asks,<br><br>[W]hat was the &#x201c;wildness&#x201d; Thoreau was describing? Critics have pointed out that Thoreau&#x2019;s cabin, on land owned by his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson, was within easy walking distance of Concord. There were rumors that he&#x2019;d had his mother do his laundry the whole time.<br><br>And indeed, his time there included many dinners with friends and family, and even a rally at the cabin for the Concord Female Anti-Slavery Society. So thoroughly networked was he that, though he might well have liked to have spent more time in jail when he was arrested for not paying his poll tax, his relatives found out about his arrest so quickly, and so immediately paid what needed to be paid, that he could not escape being released.<br><br>Still, knowing what American audiences wanted, Dillard went out of her way to emphasize her aloneness. In the first chapter, she compares her home to &#x201c;an anchorite&#x2019;s hermitage,&#x201d; and later, she writes, &#x201c;I range wild-eyed, flying over fields and plundering the woods, no longer quite fit for company.&#x201d; The only human interaction she has in the book is with a man who gives her a Styrofoam cup of coffee on a solitary drive home. The husband with whom she lives, the friends with whom she lunches, and the teammates with whom she plays softball are all conspicuously missing.<br><br>Her omissions were so extreme as to be funny to those in the know. As Dillard wrote in her journal, her friends &#x201c;said, laughing, that they got the sense I was living in this incredible wilderness.&#x201d; And certainly back when, as a grad student, I first read Pilgrim, that is the sense I got, too. In truth, though, the &#x201c;incredible wilderness&#x201d; was a stretch of woods near Hollins College, in a suburb, as Dillard came to admit. She reports:<br><br>[B]efore publishing Pilgrim [Dillard] hadn&#x2019;t realized how wild she&#x2019;d made the valley seem. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say, &#x2018;I walked by the suburban brick houses&#x2019; . . . Why would I say that to the reader? But when I saw that reviewers were acting like it was the wilderness, I said, &#x2018;Oh, shit.&#x2019; So the first thing I wrote after [that was an essay in which I pointed out,] &#x2018;This is, mind you, suburbia.&#x2019; Because I hadn&#x2019;t meant to deceive anybody. I just put in what was interesting.&#x201d;</p><h2>Wise Men of Helm</h2><p>The collection of Jewish folk tales that the New York Times called &#34;a delightful little book . . . a classic of its kind . . . full of merriment and wisdom.&#34; Illustrated with whimsical drawings, these humorous stories are just right for children.</p><p>Solomon H.

When the Marines landed, the Japanese poured out of their underground bunkers&#x2014;and launched one of the most brutal and bloody battles of World War II.&nbsp;<br><br> For three straight days, attackers and defenders fought over every square inch of sand in a battle with no defined frontlines, and where there was no possibility of retreat&#x2014;because there was nowhere to retreat to. It was a struggle that would leave both sides stunned and exhausted, and prove both the fighting mettle of the Americans and the fanatical devotion of the Japanese.<br><br> Drawn from new sources, including participants&#x2019; letters and diaries and exclusive firsthand interviews with survivors,&nbsp;<i>One Square Mile of Hell</i>&nbsp;is the true story of a battle between two determined foes, neither of whom would ever look at the other in the same way again.</p><p><b>John Wukovits</b> is a military expert and an authority on U.S. history in the Pacific Theater of World War II. He is the author of <i>Pacific Alamo: The Battle for Wake Island</i>, as well as several military biographies and many articles for such publications as <i>WWII History</i>, <i>Naval History</i>,<i> World War II</i>, <i>The Journal of Military History</i>,<i> The Naval War College Review</i>, and <i>Air Power History</i>.<b> </b>It may be impossible to write a really dull book about the 1943 battle of Tarawa. In the assault on the island, the Second Marine Division lost a thousand dead, the Japanese garrison was annihilated, and the marines learned valuable lessons about amphibious weaponry and tactics that aided them in future campaigns. Wukovits avoids a straight narrative in favor of seeing the development of the battle through the eyes of selected survivors, whom he has interviewed intelligently and thoroughly. They were impressed, as readers may be, by the strength of the Japanese fortifications and the tenacity of their garrisons, who kept the whole island under fire for two of the battle's three days. Wukovits adds emotional punch with accounts of marines who did not survive but whose memories families have kept alive for 60 years. A worthwhile battle monograph for any Pacific theater or marine collection. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Starting with strips and geometric shapes, you&#39;ll cut and sew without patterns, required yardage, or complicated diagrams. This freeing method lets you create modern quilts organically as you follow your instincts, ask &#34;what if...?&#34;, and experiment with scale, color, value, and placement.</p><p>Rayna Gillman has been creating improvisational and free-form quilts and teaching others to do the same for nearly two decades. She splits her time between New Jersey and West Palm Beach, Florida.Gillman (Hand-Printed Cloth) encourages readers to break from the confines of traditional quilting in this practical guide to the improv method. An avid quilter since 1974, Gillman decided to ditch patterns in 1996 when she took up improv quilting and began creating 'wonky, improv, original' quilts instead. Rather ironically, she has written a clean-cut guidebook for being spontaneous, using what-if prompts to encourage readers to add their own creativity. She discusses designs and fabrics, including 'repro' prints and batiks, before digging into the how-tos: 'Start simple. Clear the decks. Start with solids. Select three colors. Use one geometric shape.' She recommends beginners start with the rectangle as a base an use black, white, and a 'medium-value color that makes you smile.' Then she looks closely at the art of improvising, especially with strips and strings. She offers a gallery of other improvisers' work&#x2015;Catherine Whall Smith and Cindy Grisdela included&#x2015;and cites examples and mistakes from her own quilts. For intermediate or experienced quilters looking to get into the improv technique, this is an excellent starting point. Color photos.

People have quite forgotten that this life of ours is the path to eternity and a preparation for it: they get excited and worked up in this vale of tears. You meet very few with whom you can talk about the one thing needful. So writes this saintly Russian elder in one of his many letters from his monastery in Valamo, the monastery which was his home for over fifty years. To this monk, who died in 1958;the one thing needful is God, and the path to God is prayer;prayer unceasing; Through prayer man can once again get in touch with his heart, the core of his being, wherein the dwelling place of God is truly to be found. He urges his friends throughout his writings always to have hope, gentleness and patience, to pray for others rather than condemn them. These letters, so steeped in wisdom and humility, ring with a rare depth and simplicity. They are the letters of a true contemplative and spiritual guide, who is able to rejoice in God&#39;s love in the midst of an increasingly materialistic world, who is able to trust fully in Him, and to discern in all the circumstances of life, no matter how humble or seemingly commonplace, a meaning and a dimension of eternity.</p><p>Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>Vivid Vision: A Remarkable Tool For Aligning Your Business Around a Shared Vision of the Future</h2><p>Many corporations have slick, flashy mission statements that ultimately do little to motivate employees and less to impress customers, investors, and partners. <br><br> But there is a way to share your excitement for the future of your company in a clear, compelling, and powerful way and entrepreneur and business growth expert Cameron Herold can show you how. <br><br> <i>Vivid Vision</i> is a revolutionary tool that will help owners, CEOs, and senior managers create inspirational, detailed, and actionable three-year mission statements for their companies.

Epic, compulsively readable, and thought-provoking to the very last sentence.&#x201d; &#x2014;Blake Crouch, bestselling author of the Wayward Pines Series</p> <p>&#x201c;The searing conclusion to Sakey&#x2019;s Brilliance trilogy...raises important questions about such matters as patriotism, self-sacrifice, conflicting loyalties, and parental devotion.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, Starred Review</p> <p>&#x201c;Sakey brings his cinematic series to a ferocious close, capping off a three-book experiment in futuristic violence, societal catastrophe, and hyperkinetic storytelling...A bombastic final entry that combines larger-than-life futurism with convincing ultraviolence to deliver a satisfying, open-ended finale.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Sakey can flat-out write.&#x201d; &#x2014;Don Winslow</p> <p>&#x201c;Sakey transcends the spoon-fed dystopia of young adult epics such as The Hunger Games with thoughtful allusions to such contemporary issues as the mistreatment of minorities, global warming, government corruption and genetic engineering&#x2014;and just the right undercurrent of satire.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></p> <p>&#x201c;<i>Written in Fire</i> is so wildly imaginative in evoking its own new world order that I feel like those lucky few critics who received advance copies of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> back in the 1950s.

This time taking his skills as a mystery writer and weaving them together with themes of evolution and societal tension, creating something all together unique and impossible to put down.

To read and reread Tolkien is to share his sense of wonder and holiness, to be invited into the presence of a &#x201c;beauty beyond the circles of the world.&#x201d; It is to fall in love with a universe that has a beginning and an end, where good and bad are not subjective choices, but objective realities; a created order full of grace, though damaged by sin, in which friendship is the seedbed of the virtues, and where the greatest warriors finally become the greatest healers. A correspondent once told J. R. R. Tolkien that his work seemed illumined &#x201c;by an invisible lamp.&#x201d; That lamp is the Church, and its light is the imaginative sensibility that we live in a sacramental world. This new book by the author of The Trial of Man examines in depth the influence of Catholic sacramentality on the thought and work of Tolkien, with major emphasis on The Lord of the Rings, but including his literary essays, epistolary poem &#x201c;Mythopoeia,&#x201d; short story &#x201c;Leaf by Niggle,&#x201d; and The Silmarillion. Here is a signal contribution to a deeper understanding of Tolkien, whose mythological world is meant to &#x201c;recover&#x201d; the meaning of our own as a grace-filled place, pointing toward its Creator.</p><p>"Craig Bernthal demonstrates that Tolkien's literary vision was profoundly and concretely sacramental, and his magnificent retelling of the entire Cosmic Story shaped by the Church's most basic theological claims and its quite specific sacraments. In making these visible for the first time, Bernthal provides us with a lens for a fresh and sprightly look at Tolkien." --<b>RALPH C. WOOD</b>, author of <i>The Gospel According to Tolkien</i><i></i><br> &nbsp;<br> "Bernthal's is a unique study in fully establishing the centrality of St. John the Divine in Tolkien's life and thought. He shows, compellingly, that the sacraments of the Eucharist and penance structure the legendarium, and that <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> truly is a book of signs."&nbsp;--<b>ALISON MILBANK</b>, author of <i>Chesterton and Tolkien as Theologians</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> "Through his academic work, his heroic fiction and legendarium, and his sanctified mythic vision, Tolkien revealed worlds of beauty and terror.&nbsp;In his new book, Craig Bernthal wondrously uncovers the numerous layers in Tolkien's thought as well as the nuances, the trajectories, and even the empty spaces, immense with possibilities." --<b>BRADLEY J. BIRZER</b>, author of <i>J.R.R. Tolkien's Sanctifying Myth </i><br> <i><br> </i>"Having enjoyed Craig Bernthal's&nbsp;excellent book on Shakespeare, I am delighted that he has turned the keen edge of his considerable intellect to the Catholicism of Middle-earth. This is a work that will thrill and enthrall all those who wish to delve deeper into Tolkien's world." &nbsp;--<b>JOSEPH PEARCE</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Tolkien: Man &amp; Myth</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Bilbo's Journey: Discovering the Hidden Meaning of The Hobbit</i>.Craig Bernthal is Professor of English at California State University, Fresno, where he has taught Shakespeare and Renaissance literature for 26 years. He has published articles, essays, short fiction, and two books: <i>The Trial of Man: Christianity and Judgment in the World of Shakespeare</i> and <i>Perfection in Bad Axe</i>, a book of short stories.

To reconstruct the tumultuous hundred days between Yalta and the fall of Berlin, John Toland traveled more than 100,000 miles in twenty-one countries and interviewed more than six hundred people&#x2014;from Hitler&#x2019;s personal chauffeur to Generals von Manteuffel, Wenck, and Heinrici; from underground leaders to diplomats; from top Allied field commanders to brave young GIs. Toland adeptly weaves together these interviews using research from thousands of primary sources. <br><br>When it was first published, <i>The Last 100 Days</i> made history, revealing after-action reports, staff journals, and top-secret messages and personal documents previously unavailable to historians. Since that time, it has come to be regarded as one of the greatest historical narratives of the twentieth century.</p><p>&#x201c;Fascinating . . . The narrative shifts from scene to intimate scene of every conference room . . . from liberated camp to Hitler&#x2019;s underground bunker, to GIs storming the railroad bridge across the Rhine. . . .

You may be 35 and experiencing low energy, 50 and going through menopausal brain fog, or 75 and waking up each morning with arthritic pain. The good news is that, whatever your age, I will show you the ways to regenerate and revitalize. Welcome to your Second Spring.</p><p>I was inspired to write this book by watching my mother go through her middle years. Other women of her generation retired with their husbands and turned away from the world, but this was not her way. My mother energized and revitalized herself with Chinese medicine and refashioned her purpose in life. With her new freedom and the perspective of long experience, she turned her attention to interests that had developed gradually during her householding years. I looked on in admiration as she became a minister in her religious organization and turned her home into a temple to serve her community. In our family, my father, a doctor, was the public face of Chinese wisdom and tradition, while my mother, with all her character and dignity, was a modest woman who remained within the domestic sphere. Yet her personal transformation taught me more about human potential than I have learned from any other individual. It called into question the very concept of aging.</p><p>How do you feel about your age? Do you value yourself as you are? Your health at any point of your life depends on both your physical condition and your emotional attitudes about yourself and your life.</p><p>You can look and feel younger than your actual years and move through perimenopause, menopause, and beyond with grace, youthfulness, vitality, and health. Aging does not have to be a downhill slide. This book can help you achieve all this naturally -- without drugs, hormone replacement, or invasive surgery. How? Through the wisdom of Chinese medicine, which is sensitive to all aspects of a woman's life cycle and understands that every phase affords opportunities to slow or reverse the aging process. This powerful tradition, integrated with Western medicine, can produce the optimum outcome for each individual.</p><p>On the emotional plane, Chinese tradition offers a paradigm completely different from the Western vision of midlife and aging. To the Chinese, this is the time when a woman truly comes into her own, when the distractions of the householding, childbearing, and child-rearing years wind down and her inner beauty emerges. A mature woman is a work of art crafted by her experiences and her own inner resources. She now refines her wisdom and finds traditional or inventive ways to make it useful in the world. Far from ceasing to grow, she embarks on a new path of self-realization.<br></p><p><b>Secrets to Our Success</b></p><p>At the Tao of Wellness, my brother Dr. Daoshing Ni and I, along with our team of associates, have helped thousands of women over the last 25 years. Our success is attributable to three factors. First, women have always been the cornerstone of Chinese society. From its inception thousands of years ago, Chinese medicine has developed a comprehensive specialty in women's health that is unrivaled in the world. Second, we draw on a profound knowledge base in women's health care, passed down through 38 continuous generations of doctors in our family. The third and most important ingredient is our patients' trust in our care and eagerness to do their part. Their willingness to inhabit new ideas and behaviors allows us to coach them through their Second Spring and help each one individually to reclaim her personal and sexual vigor.<br><b></b></p><p><b>Women's Cycles and Regeneration at Each Stage</b></p><p>Biologically, the ultimate purpose of human life, as with all living creatures on our planet, is reproduction, to pass on our genes from one generation to another. So, it is no surprise that, when you reach reproductive maturity, the organism's vitality starts to wane. This biological decline is programmed to begin in women around age 35. Of course, you can still live a long and fulfilling life, free from illness and disability, after that age, but you may benefit from some help with the changes your mind, body, and spirit will go through.</p><p>Menopause signifies the end of a woman's menstrual cycle and a major turning point in her life. Every woman's experience with it is unique. Most women stop menstruating between the ages of 48 and 52, but uncomfortable symptoms of perimenopause -- the premenopausal period -- can begin as early as 35 and last into menopause and beyond. Some women go through perimenopause in two to three years, but for others it lasts as long as 12 or 15 years. It may start with an irregular menstrual cycle along with an increase in premenstrual symptoms or PMS.</p><p>As you get closer to menopause and the cessation of your menstruation, new and more extreme effects appear, which can include hot flashes, insomnia, weight gain, and vaginal dryness. For the Chinese, menopause connotes the emptying of the conception channel and the depletion of the fertility essence, but it is also a time for generation of a new vital energy and the ripening of identity. Chinese medicine, attuned to every phase of a woman's reproductive cycle, uses methods tested by time and tradition to reinvigorate the body and mind at each stage.<br><b></b></p><p><b>The Second Spring: Rebirth at Midlife</b></p><p>With its intimate understanding of the female body, Chinese traditional medicine has always addressed the special needs of women throughout their lives, including conception, pregnancy, and childbearing as well as the onset of menopause. In fact, the wisdom about regeneration during menopause is so well recognized that there is a term for it: <i>Second Spring.</i> A woman's Second Spring is the renaissance of youthful vitality and sexual vigor she enjoys when she takes advantage of the secrets and natural powers of Chinese medicine. When the body begins to undergo the changes that take her through perimenopause, menopause, and beyond, in the Chinese perspective this is a time for celebration in a woman's life, when she is possessed of wisdom and graceful beauty. This positive outlook on aging stands in stark contrast to the Western stigma against growing old. Second Spring describes an important opportunity for self-discovery and renewal in women's lives.</p><p>As you move toward menopause and beyond, your body produces less of the essential hormones, mainly estrogen and progesterone, that maintain the health of your bones and the elasticity of your blood vessels and skin. Of the many consequences, osteoporosis and heart disease are the two conditions most emphasized by the Western medical community, but quality-of-life issues such as wrinkled skin, lower vitality, and decreased libido can also become disheartening and affect other aspects of health. Emotionally, some Western women dread menopause as a loss of youth and fertility. To add to the physical challenges, in our youth-obsessed society menopause often means the beginning of an unspoken social devaluation for a woman.</p><p>But the truth is that no one need be a helpless victim to this phase of life. With the guidance of Chinese medicine, every woman can turn these changes into an empowering experience of rejuvenation.<br><b></b></p><p><b>The Western Medical Approach to Women's Health, Menopause, and Beyond<br></b></p><p>Women's health needs during and after menopause have been addressed quite differently by the Western medical establishment than by Eastern traditions and integrative medical approaches. In the mid-19th century, a menopausal woman suffering hot flashes, depression, and painful, irregular periods would sometimes undergo a <i>hysterectomy</i> -- surgical removal of the uterus -- on the misconception that this organ was the source of women's physical and mental problems. Although doctors' understanding of these matters changed, the rate of hysterectomies remained high, and a large percentage of the operations were later found to be unnecessary.</p><p>In the past 40 years, Western medicine's solution for menopause has been the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Its greatest popularizer was a gynecologist named Robert Wilson, whose outlook revealed more than a little sexism and ageism. He called menopause a "living decay." Supplemental estrogen, he and others insisted, was the ultimate answer.</p><p>Belief in the benefits of long-term HRT became entrenched in the medical community and among women of menopausal age. Doctors who delved into the issue more closely, however, were often surprised to learn how thin the evidence really was. Finally, in 2002, after decades of routine hormone replacement therapy, the landmark Women's Health Initiative made front-page headlines all over the country, and the news wasn't good. The study proved conclusively that HRT with a common blend of estrogen and progestin, when used for more than four years, increased women's risk of breast cancer, heart disease, stroke, and blood clots. Further studies confirmed that the risks of long-term HRT outweigh the benefits.</p><p>Chinese medicine has long recognized that the body is fully capable of regenerating and that supporting the natural production of all the essential hormones through natural means is safe, effective, and sustainable over a woman's lifetime. In other words, teach your body to rejuvenate itself instead of replacing your body's natural abilities.<br><b></b></p><p><b>Start Now to Create Your Personal Second Spring<br></b></p><p>It's important to get ready for the changes ahead.

At the start of the battle, the Red Army appeared to be on the verge of advancing through Poland into Germany to expand the Soviet revolution. Had the war spread into Germany, another great European war would have ensued, dragging in France and Britain. However, the Red Army was defeated by &#x201c;the miracle on the Vistula.&#x201d;</p><p> This campaign title explores the origins and outcomes of this momentous battle. In May 1920, the Polish Army intervened in war-torn Ukraine, pushing all the way to Kiev, but the Red Army, by now triumphant in most of the theaters of the Russian Civil War, turned its attention to this new threat. By the late summer of 1920, two Soviet armies had advanced into Poland and the overconfident Soviet leadership dreamed of advancing over a prostrate Polish Army into neighboring Germany to ignite a Communist revolution in the heart of Europe. </p><p>Thanks to the low density of forces on both sides and the huge distances involved, the conflict was a war of maneuver, with a curious mixture of traditional and advanced tactics. Horse cavalry played a dominant role in the fighting, but airplanes, tanks, and armored trains lent the war an air of modernity. This illustrated study explores the war through the lens of the Battle of Warsaw, the turning point when, after a summer of disastrous retreat, the Polish army rallied and repulsed the Red Army at Warsaw and Lwow.</p></p><p><p><b>Steven J.

He lives in Honolulu, Hawai'i.</p><p>1PRISON HEARTLAND</p><p>There&#x2019;s tough. And then there&#x2019;s Texas tough.</p><p>&#x2014;LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR DAVID DEWHURST</p><p>If we are to fully understand the causes and consequences of America&#x2019;s prison buildup, a good place to start is Huntsville, Texas. Although dozens of prison-dominated communities now dot the American landscape from Florence, Arizona, to Wallens Ridge, Virginia, Huntsville stands above the rest: It is the most locked-down town in the most prison-friendly state in the most incarcerated country in the world. Although America&#x2019;s sprawling penal system&#x2014;a collection of some five thousand federal and state prisons, not to mention local jails&#x2014;is highly decentralized, Huntsville, perhaps even more than Washington, D.C., could stake a claim to serve as its capital city. For 160 years, it has coordinated criminal punishment for the Lone Star State and in the last half century, it has stood at the forefront of a carceral revolution that has remade American society and governance.</p><p>A sleepy town surrounded by pine forests and tumbledown farms, seventy miles north of Houston, Huntsville was selected in 1848 to build the state&#x2019;s first residential institution, a penitentiary. Ever since, the community&#x2019;s fortunes have depended on crime and punishment; as Texas&#x2019;s prison system grew, so did Huntsville. &#x201c;We sort of live within the shadows of the Walls,&#x201c; comments Jim Willett, a longtime resident and former warden. &#x201c;Three times a day we hear the &#x2018;all clear&#x2019; count whistle. When you think about it, it marks the passing of our days.&#x201d;</p><p>Today more than ever, imprisonment is Huntsville&#x2019;s lifeblood. Nearly half of the town&#x2019;s residents (16,227 out of 35,567) live behind bars. Some 7,500 adults earn their paychecks keeping them there. Each morning, thousands of guards in ill-fitting gray uniforms pile into pickups and head to one of the area&#x2019;s nine prisons, while starched administrators drive to one of the offices that make up the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) headquarters. From their cubicles they oversee the largest state prison system in the United States, one that incarcerates more people than Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands combined. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve grown so massive, we need a building like the Pentagon,&#x201c; remarks a harried TDCJ bureaucrat.</p><p>At first glance, Huntsville looks like any other small southern city. National chains dominate the two main highway exits. In prosperous neighborhoods, spacious homes line up behind tidy lawns along wide, oak-draped streets. In the poorest sections, weather-worn shotgun houses share overgrown lots with rusting trailers. Although Huntsville has a college, Sam Houston State University, churches outnumber bars and hunting shops outnumber cinemas. A well-kept central plaza features a new limestone court house, but downtown merchants have fallen on hard times since Wal-Mart began siphoning retail dollars to the outskirts. Roger&#x2019;s Shoes and Ernst Jewelers cling to life behind historic storefronts, but out of habit more than profit. Like most American towns, Hunts-ville is increasingly governed by the economics of scale and the geography of parking.</p><p>What sets Huntsville apart is the prison business. Just a stone&#x2019;s throw from the plaza rises the town&#x2019;s most impressive and imposing building, a redbrick fortress known as &#x201c;the Walls,&#x201c; Texas&#x2019;s flagship penitentiary. Surrounded by twenty-five-foot fortifications, the Walls complex contains a small town in its own right: office space, kitchen facilities, an auto shop, massive classrooms, a chapel, an infirmary, and, most famously, the busiest death house in the nation. Some of the structures are twenty-first-century vintage, others nineteenth. &#x201c;Working at the Walls you have a special sense of history,&#x201c; says Willett, a heavyset man with droopy eyes who served as warden for four years. Some longtime residents claim the prison has been locking up and executing offenders for so long that restless ghosts prowl its dusty tiers.</p><p>The Walls is Huntsville&#x2019;s icon, but rival landmarks abound. Just beyond the prison&#x2019;s eastern gun towers, a crumbling stadium recalls the &#x201c;world&#x2019;s toughest rodeo,&#x201c; a gladiatorial convict spectacular that served as one of Texas&#x2019;s main tourist attractions between 1931 and 1986. A short walk down the road sits an army surplus store, formerly named Bustin&#x2019; Loose Mens Wear, the first stop for roughly two hundred prisoners released daily. Adjacent to the Greyhound station, where ex-cons exchange vouchers for one-way tickets to Dallas or Houston, the shop buys used prison-issue boots for two dollars and proudly announces, &#x201c;TDCJ discharge checks cashed for free.&#x201d; Many prisoners spend their entire fifty-dollar allotment before they leave town.</p><p>For less fortunate inmates who are discharged in boxes rather than boots, the final destination is often a somber expanse of lawn spread out behind the prison&#x2019;s back gate: Captain Joe Byrd Cemetery. With spare concrete crosses forming gridlines across the grass&#x2014;like Arlington without the honor&#x2014;the graveyard has marked the end of the line for forsaken convicts for as long as anyone can remember. In the older sections, weather-beaten headstones are sinking into the soil, many of them identified only by a prison number, some marked with an X for execution. Along the edge, a row of fresh pits covered by metal plates await another round of indigents. Resting against one headstone, a faded display of blue plastic flowers spells out &#x201c;DAD.&#x201d;</p><p>Drive in any direction from the Walls and you will soon run into other TDCJ institutions: a massive transfer facility that brings new inmates into the system, a gleaming supermax that points toward Texas&#x2019;s high-tech future, or an expansive prison plantation that gestures toward its past.</p><p>Residents of Huntsville are conscious, even proud of their prison history. In 1989, a local foundation opened the Texas Prison Museum, a squat redbrick building made to resemble a prison, wedged between two real prisons on the north side of town. Jim Willett, whose gentle manner and nasal voice are hard to reconcile with his long career as a warden, serves as the museum&#x2019;s director. Four days a week, he works the front desk, hawking bobble-head convict dolls and sharing escape and riot stories with oldtimers who drop by in the afternoons. Although the museum&#x2019;s exhibit room features humdrum poster-board displays, visitors take their time. They inspect faded striped uniforms, rusted cane knives, and a thick leather strap known as &#x201c;the Bat.&#x201d; Clyde Barrow of Bonnie and Clyde fame, the state&#x2019;s most notorious escapee, and Fred Carrasco, its most infamous hostage taker, have special prominence, as does the prison system&#x2019;s epic civil rights lawsuit, Ruiz v. Estelle, in which Texas prisons were declared &#x201c;cruel and unusual&#x201d; by a federal judge in 1980. What holds visitors&#x2019; gaze the longest, however, is a sturdy, stiff-backed, generously proportioned oak armchair with leather restraints and a metal headband. This is Old Sparky, the electric chair that Texas officials used to cut short 361 lives between 1924 and 1964.</p><p>Most visitors don&#x2019;t realize that Willett himself supervised eighty-nine executions&#x2014;albeit standing over a gurney rather than a chair&#x2014;more than any other living American. If they stop to ask, he&#x2019;ll say that executions were the most unpleasant part of his job. &#x201c;I guess I haven&#x2019;t fully made up my mind about the death penalty,&#x201c; he said shortly after we first met, an honest but jarring remark from a man who used to carry it out, sometimes two or three times a week. Having read through grisly case briefings prepared by the Texas attorney general, Willett is convinced that most of the men and women he watched die earned their fate. But as a Christian, he isn&#x2019;t sure it was his due to seal it.</p><p>Huntsville packs its prison memories, both flattering and unsettling, into this modest, sun-baked museum, but history spills beyond it. To outsiders, the town can feel like a living theme park, a grittier version of Colonial Williamsburg. The stately homes of top TDCJ administrators are tended by convict &#x201c;yard boys&#x201d; with outdoor trusty status. When I stopped to ask for directions on one of my first visits, a portly African American trusty quickly reminded me that deferential etiquette still rules. Dropping his rake, he hoofed it over to my rental, hat in hand, and asked, &#x201c;Yes sir, what can I do for you, boss?&#x201d; Up the road at the gate to the Wynne Farm, Texas&#x2019;s oldest prison plantation, I watched as a squad of convict cotton pickers, almost all of them black, marched out to the fields, their duck-cloth coveralls gleaming in the early morning light. Trailing them on horse back was a white overseer, a 30-30 jostling in his scabbard.</p><p>Southern justice brings southern history close to the surface in Huntsville, lending credence to William Faulkner&#x2019;s oft-cited observation that in the South, &#x201c;the past is never dead, it&#x2019;s not even past.&#x201d; Yet Huntsville isn&#x2019;t trapped looking backward. Thanks overwhelmingly to the state&#x2019;s breakneck prison buildup, it&#x2019;s racing into the future. Since 1980, the local prison workforce has more than qua drupled, and although prison jobs are low paying, new strip malls, highway interchanges, and pre-fab apartment complexes all attest to economic growth. As Forbes magazine observes, Huntsville is a &#x201c;town where crime pays.&#x201d;</p><p>To a remarkable extent, this unassuming backwoods community has become a crossroads. Thousands of law enforcement and corrections officers cycle through each year for training, while inmates, by the tens of thousands, arrive for intake or discharge. From TDCJ&#x2019;s headquarters across the street from the Walls, administrators manage a $2.4 billion annual corrections bud get.

Stuck at an out-of-town convention, waiting to receive a lifetime achievement award, Hal's weekend takes us on a dark ride through the secret history of a medium that's always been haunted by crooks, swindlers, and desperate dreamers. <br><br><b>BAD WEEKEND</b>-the story some are already calling the comic of the year from its serialization in <b>CRIMINAL</b> #2 and 3-has been expanded, with several new scenes added and remastered into a hardcover graphic novel, in the same format as <b>BRUBAKER </b>and <b>PHILLIPS</b>' (<b>KILL OR BE KILLED</b>, <b>FATALE</b>, <b>CRIMINAL</b>) bestselling <b>MY HEROES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN JUNKIES</b>. This gorgeous package is a must-have, an evergreen graphic novel every true comics fan will want to own.<br><br><b>Collects CRIMINAL #2-3 with expanded content</b><br></p><p>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY -- The lauded crime comics team of Brubaker and Phillips (My Heroes Have Always Been Junkies) take a meta approach with a hard-boiled mystery set at a comics convention. Cartoonist Hal Crane, "a collection of bad habits and worse moods," is traveling to an event clearly based on the San Diego Comic-Con to receive a lifetime achievement award, and his former art assistant Jacob, now a detective, is hired to escort him. The two are quickly embroiled in a mystery involving stolen art, murder, and decades of industry feuds. Set in 1997, when the comics speculation boom of the '90s was going bust and comic books were at a sales peak but a creative nadir, the period's perfect for a tale rife with creative frustration, seedy backroom deals, and betrayal. It helps that the creators know the behind-the-scenes workings of the comic convention inside and out, which lends verisimilitude, as does the semifictional comics history they tell, a blend of reality, gossip (did an inker really get work by procuring sex workers for his editors?), and pure imagination. Phillips's art looks heavily photo-referenced, but poses and layouts that would be stiff in a lesser artist's hands fly by as realistic, while still loose and lively, in his practiced lines. Brubaker proves again that, as in the words of legendary creator Jack Kirby, "Comics will break your heart," as he digs under the colorful surface of his setting and touches on injustices within the industry. <br><br><br>FORBES -- <i>Bad Weekend </i>paints an acid-etched portrait of fandom, comics professionals and Comic-Con itself - one that rings true to anyone with connections to the industry and culture. As comics and comic art have grown in prominence, and the latter has become a very big-money business indeed, it's important to keep it real when it comes to the shady dealings and complicated legacies that form the roots of the industry. It's also entertaining as hell. After more than a dozen years of the award-winning comics-noir series, Brubaker and Phillips know how to blend their art and storytelling styles into a polished page-turner. <i>Bad Weekend </i>from Image Comics will be available in comics shops on Wednesday, July 10 and available in bookstores on Tuesday, July 16. and makes a fine summer read for anyone who's heading to Comic-Con next week, or wishes they were.<br></p><h2>The Effect (Modern Classics)</h2><p><p><i>I can tell the difference between who I am and a side effect.</i></p><p><i>The Effect</i> is a clinical romance.

Bosworth&#x2014;the foremost scholar on the subject writing in English&#x2014;vividly brings to life the period in which Italians participated in one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most notorious political experiments. Il Duce&#x2019;s Fascists were the original totalitarians, espousing a cult of violence and obedience that inspired many other dictatorships, Hitler&#x2019;s first among them. But as Bosworth reveals, many Italians resisted its ideology, finding ways, ingenious and varied, to keep Fascism from taking hold as deeply as it did in Germany. A sweeping chronicle of struggle in terrible times, this is the definitive account of Italy&#x2019;s darkest hour.</p><p><b>R. J. B. Bosworth </b>is an Australian historian and author and a recognized expert on Fascist Italy. He taught history at the University of Sydney and the University of Western Australia, and was a senior research fellow at Jesus College, Oxford. A fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and of the Australian Academy of the Humanities, Bosworth is the author of <i>Mussolini's Italy: Life Under the Fascist Dictatorship, 1915&#x2013;1945</i> and <i>The Oxford Handbook of Fascism</i>.In the middle of the 19th century, two national causes above all others excited the enthusiasm of European liberals: the unification of Italy and the unification of Germany. As if to illustrate the saying about the grief brought by answered prayers, these unions duly came to pass -- the one as a joke, the other a nightmare.<p>But maybe we should be careful about smiling too indulgently at Italy under the fascist regime run by Benito Mussolini from 1922 to 1943. Of course that despotism, even though it liked to call itself "totalitarian," was mild compared to its contemporaries in Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany -- perhaps in part because of an Italian tendency not to take politics too seriously and a certain indifference to politicians, democratic or despotic. We should not exaggerate the Italians' lovable "national character" or simply think of them as a brava gente ("nice people"), R.J.B. Bosworth suggests, since plenty of meanness and brutality was brought out by il facscimo. But he acknowledges that it never turned as nasty as other versions elsewhere, and his book helps explain why this was so. </p><p>An Australian scholar and one of the outstanding historians of modern Italy, Bosworth is the author of a 2002 biography of Mussolini that was rightly acclaimed as perhaps the best yet written. As a companion to that life of the man who ruled the country, he has now written an absorbing book about the country Mussolini ruled. Bosworth begins with the political and intellectual roots of fascism, such as they were. Although fascism, with its glorification of the state and the leader, is meant to be right-wing, it had obvious features in common with supposedly left-wing forms of totalitarianism: Hitler called himself a National Socialist, and Mussolini indeed began as a socialist of the hard left. The new movement took its name from fascio, the Italian word for a group of people, and many organizations used the term before Mussolini came to power; the fasces was the ominous bundle of rods and axes representing the retributive authority of the Roman magistrates. (And the symbol resonated far beyond Italy: You can still see the fasces carved on official buildings in the United States.)</p><p> As in Russia, the crisis of war provided an opportunity for the rapid destruction of lawful government. Despite Italy's ostensible position as one of the winners of World War I, victory gave little sturdiness to Italian democracy, and the country's parliamentary government collapsed at the first sharp push from Mussolini in 1922. Much like Germans in 1933, Italians flooded to join what had now become the Partito Nazionale Fascista. </p><p>And yet Italian fascism was always more rhetoric than reality. It was no accident that Mussolini was a journalist, who had once commented volubly on international affairs and remained ever-ready "with an opinion on anything." (His collected works are published in 44 volumes -- imagine even dipping into them, let alone reading them through.) Italy was a backward country when Mussolini took power. One of the many fascinating details in which Bosworth's book abounds tells us that, in World War I, only one per thousand draftees in the German army was illiterate -- itself an astonishing fact -- as against 68 per thousand in the French army and 330 per thousand in the Italian one. And for all the sham and bluster, Italy remained backward under fascism. Even by 1940, there were only a million radios in Italy and half a million telephones, for a population of some 44 million. </p><p> A book of this kind relies on statistical and impressionistic descripition, and Bosworth's deep knowledge of Italy, based on wide archival and primary study, is continually illuminating. On the one hand, he gives numerous short biographical sketches of people drawn to fascism, many (though not all) of them worthless, marginal men for whom the party offered a career. On the other, he paints a broad canvas of ordinary Italian life in the 1920s and '30s and shows how it was affected -- or not -- by the regime.</p><p> Unlike too many neglectful historians, Bosworth pays due attention to the subject of sports, which played an important role in fascism. Italy was more successful on the sporting field than the battlefield, winning soccer's World Cup in 1934 and 1938 (something not likely to be repeated this summer) -- although when the Italian heavyweight Primo Carnera met Joe Louis in New York in June 1935, the result sent a thrill through Harlem rather than Rome. Still, Bosworth has his own blind spots here: Although I take my hat off to a professor who has published a learned paper on "Golf and Italian Fascism," he should surely have mentioned the great Italian cyclists of the age, including Ottavio Bottecchia, winner of the Tour de France in 1924 and 1925, an anti-fascist whose mysterious death just before the 1927 Tour was widely believed to be political murder. </p><p> A lighter touch would have been welcome elsewhere. There is no point in complaining any more about the political correction of academic history, but Bosworth's attempts to pay his dues are sometimes risible. We learn that the remote village of Oschiri was "a place of gender and political contest," which proves to mean the astounding fact that simple peasant women followed the lead of their priest. And Bosworth solemnly tells us "that most enlisted men preferred a masculine interpretation of the gender order." You don't say, professore.</p><p> What now seems to us the most unlikely part of the story is the part played by many Jews in the fascist regime, at least until Mussolini began his contemptible groveling to Germany in the late 1930s. But then the small, prosperous Jewish community was more integrated in Italy than in any other European country, producing before 1914 prime ministers, senators and generals. Mussolini insisted early on that fascism was not anti-Semitic, and even toward the dismal end of his life, he had no enthusiasm for the murderous terror visited on the European Jews. </p><p>Much of the story told in this book is not as grim as the fate of the Italian Jews. "The lighter side of fascism" sounds a subject for P.J. O'Rourke, but one has to admit that there is comic relief to be found here -- and not just from the anti-regime jokes that hearteningly persisted throughout. Even the story of Italian imperialism in Africa, though replete with shocking cruelty, was part opera buffa, as shown by the life of Italo Balbo, a fascist leader who began as a saber-rattling patriot and ended -- in more senses than one -- as governor of Libya. This had been Italy's first African acquisition, in 1912, fully 10 years before Mussolini came to power, and Italian rule was a farce throughout. Fascism boasted of how its empire would enrich the patria, but the Italians managed to rule Libya for decades without ever noticing that it contained a vast oil field. Then in 1940, Mussolini cynically and opportunistically declared war on France and England and began his doom. Shortly afterward, Balbo became one of his country's first victims of the war when his plane was shot down -- by an Italian anti-aircraft battery whose gunnery was better than its aircraft recognition. Sometimes you do have to see the funny side of things.</p><p>In the end, the failures of Mussolini's regime were an indirect credit to the Italian people, and maybe brava gente isn't so wrong after all. While Hitler succeeded all too well in making many Germans into a nation of conquerors and killers, the Italians quite ignored Mussolini's attempt to do the same thing to them. Indeed, maybe Hitler should have the last word: The "decadent Italians" had never had their hearts in fascism, and they lacked the hardness necessary for conquest, the F�hrer fumed, since "the excessive warmth of family relations there overwhelms all the rest."

Of the seven symphonies he composed, each differs greatly from the others, for Sibelius rarely approached the symphonic "problem" the same way. Each work seems committed to the thoughts, feelings and logic of the moment.<br> Sibelius's first two symphonies remain among his most accessible and popular. Of all his symphonic works, perhaps the First Symphony, composed in 1898&#x2013;99, adheres most to classical form yet reflects the spirit of Nordic nationalism that came to be associated with the composer&#x2019;s music.<br> The Second Symphony, perhaps his most expansive and melodious work in symphonic form, demonstrates Sibelius's increasing command of orchestral form and scoring. These two major works are reprinted here from the definitive full-score editions published by Breitkopf &amp; H�rtel of Leipzig.</p><p></p><h2>The Thirty-Year Genocide: Turkey&#x2019;s Destruction of Its Christian Minorities, 1894&#x2013;1924</h2><p><p><b>A reappraisal of the giant massacres perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire, and then the Turkish Republic, against their Christian minorities.</b></p><p>Between 1894 and 1924, three waves of violence swept across Anatolia, targeting the region&#x2019;s Christian minorities, who had previously accounted for 20 percent of the population. By 1924, the Armenians, Assyrians, and Greeks had been reduced to 2 percent. Most historians have treated these waves as distinct, isolated events, and successive Turkish governments presented them as an unfortunate sequence of accidents. <i>The Thirty-Year Genocide</i> is the first account to show that the three were actually part of a single, continuing, and intentional effort to wipe out Anatolia&#x2019;s Christian population.</p><p>The years in question, the most violent in the recent history of the region, began during the reign of the Ottoman sultan Abdulhamid II, continued under the Young Turks, and ended during the first years of the Turkish Republic founded by Ataturk. Yet despite the dramatic swing from the Islamizing autocracy of the sultan to the secularizing republicanism of the post&#x2013;World War I period, the nation&#x2019;s annihilationist policies were remarkably constant, with continual recourse to premeditated mass killing, homicidal deportation, forced conversion, mass rape, and brutal abduction. And one thing more was a constant: the rallying cry of jihad. While not justified under the teachings of Islam, the killing of two million Christians was effected through the calculated exhortation of the Turks to create a pure Muslim nation.</p><p>Revelatory and impeccably researched, Benny Morris and Dror Ze&#x2019;evi&#x2019;s account is certain to transform how we see one of modern history&#x2019;s most horrific events.</p></p><p>Benny Morris, Professor Emeritus in the Department of Middle Eastern Studies at Ben Gurion University of the Negev, has published books about the history of the Zionist&#x2013;Arab conflict.

Like their northern neighbors, Rhode Islanders bought and sold slaves and supplies that sustained plantations throughout the Americas; however, nowhere else was this business so important. During the colonial period trade with West Indian planters provided Rhode Islanders with molasses, the key ingredient for their number one export: rum. More than 60 percent of all the slave ships that left North America left from Rhode Island. During the antebellum period Rhode Islanders were the leading producers of &#x201c;negro cloth,&#x201d; a coarse wool-cotton material made especially for enslaved blacks in the American South.</p><p>Clark-Pujara draws on the documents of the state, the business, organizational, and personal records of their enslavers, and the few first-hand accounts left by enslaved and free black Rhode Islanders to reconstruct their lived experiences. The business of slavery encouraged slaveholding, slowed emancipation and led to circumscribed black freedom. Enslaved and free black people pushed back against their bondage and the restrictions placed on their freedom. It is convenient, especially for northerners, to think of slavery as southern institution. The erasure or marginalization of the northern black experience and the centrality of the business of slavery to the northern economy allows for a dangerous fiction&#x2015;that North has no history of racism to overcome. But we cannot afford such a delusion if we are to truly reconcile with our past.</p></p><p><b>Christy Clark-Pujara</b> is Associate Professor of History in the Afro-American Studies Department at the University of Wisconsin&#x2015;Madison."Clark-Pujara&#x2019;s work (the first study to take enslaved people, and slavery and its legacy in Rhode Island, as its primary focus) demonstrates just how central slavery was to the Rhode Island economy, both before Rhode Island passed its gradual emancipation law in 1784, and for many decades after... Dark Work is an engaging, sophisticated monograph that does vital work in writing enslaved and free African American Rhode Islanders back, both into the history of &#x201c;big&#x201d; national and local events of the American Revolution, the Dorr Rebellion, and the Civil War, and into &#x201c;small&#x201d; histories of daily life in Rhode Island (documenting African Americans&#x2019; ongoing efforts to control their lives, in a system fundamentally opposed to them doing so). An elegant, insightful work of scholarship." (Journal of American Ethnic History)<br><br>"[This] author's sharply focused monograph exploring the impact of slavery on Rhode Island's black population is a valuable addition to the historiography that now assumes the centrality of slavery in the North and the compatibility therein of capitalism and slavery." (<i>Historian</i>)<br><br>"This timely and innovative study of of slavery and African American life in Rhode Island reveals the simultaneous development of slavery and capitalism in the Age of Revolution. Especially eye-opening are the sagas of white Rhode Island families profiting from the Atlantic slave trade and internal commerce after the American Revolution. Countering the financial power of local powers of slavery were the continued struggles, fully explored through the Civil War by Christy Clark-Pujara, by African Americans to create community and expand their civil rights." (Graham Russell Gao Hodges,George Dorland Langdon, Jr. Professor of History and Africana Studies, Colgate University)<br><br>"Dark Work is a sweeping overview of the African American experience in Rhode Island from the colonial period through the Civil War... a valuable resource." (Agricultural History)<br><br>"It is well-known that Rhode Island's mercantile and manufacturing economies served the larger Atlantic plantation complex, but Clark-Pujara asks an important new question: how did the black freedom struggle unfold in a place materially invested and implicated in the expansion of human bondage across in the Americas? Clark-Pujara reconstructs the lives and livelihoods of black Rhode Islanders, for whom the violence of enslavement, the prospects of emancipation, and the limits of freedom unfolded in accordance with the demands for food in the Caribbean, for slaves in the Carolinas, and for clothing in Louisiana."

Unable to resist his appetite for scientific investigation, Galileo's heretical discoveries about the solar system bring him to the attention of the Inquisition.

The range of ethical systems and moral philosophies available can be confusing to people seeking clarity about what the different theories mean for everyday life. <em>Christian Ethics: Four Views</em> presents a dialogue between four main approaches to ethics in the Christian tradition. Virtue ethics focuses less on the action itself and more on the virtuous character of the moral agent. A divine command approach looks instead at whether an action has been commanded by God, in which case it is morally right. Natural law ethics argues for a universal, objective morality grounded in nature. Finally, prophetic ethics judges what is morally right in light of a biblical understanding of divine justice and shalom. The four views and their proponents are as follows: <ul><li>Brad J. Kallenberg: Virtue Ethics</li><li>John Hare: Divine Command Ethics</li><li>Claire Peterson: Natural Law Ethics</li><li>Peter Heltzel: Prophetic Ethics</li></ul><em>Christian Ethics: Four Views</em>, edited by noted ethicist Steve Wilkens, presents an accessible introduction to the key positions in Christian ethics today.</p><p>Steve Wilkens is professor of philosophy and ethics at Azusa Pacific University.

Murder. It&#39;s Christmastime, and farmer Lucy Resnick is living the life she&#39;s always dreamed of. When she&#39;s not selling her jams, soaps, and mistletoe bundles at the Buttercup Christmas Market, she&#39;s enjoying cozy evenings by the fire with her knitting group--or her handsome veterinarian boyfriend Tobias Brandt. But less than a week before Christmas, a pall falls over the festive atmosphere when local man Randy Stone turns up with a knife in his back... and a sprig of mistletoe in his hair. Local sheriff Rooster Kocurek, never the brightest bulb on the string, is convinced it&#39;s an open-and-shut case--murder by jealous wife--but Lucy suspects otherwise. She soon discovers that Randy&#39;s life was more tangled than last year&#39;s Christmas lights... and that unless she wraps up the case fast, there might be more than one funeral this holiday season.</p><p>Karen is the housework-impaired author of multiple mystery series, and her victims number well into the double digits.

King and partner uncover a bizarre tangle of events that could have disastrous consequences. Ron McLarty is the perfect choice to present Baldacci&#39;s latest thriller.

From dawn through to dusk, there are changes in light, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. However, these changes are regular, rhythmic and, therefore, predictable.

Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman has described financial advising as a prescriptive activity whose main objective should be to guide investors to make decisions that serve their best interests. The reality? That's easier said than done. In the <i>Second Edition</i> of <i>Behavioral Finance and Wealth Management</i>, Michael Pompian takes a practical approach to the growing science of behavioral finance, and puts it to use for real investors. He applies knowledge of 20 of the most prominent individual investor biases into "behaviorally-modified" asset allocation decisions. Offering investors and financial advisors a "self-help" book, Pompian shows how to create investment strategies that leverage the latest cutting edge research into behavioral biases of individual investors. This book:</p> <ul> <li>Shows investors and financial advisors how to either moderate or adapt to behavioral biases, in order to improve investment results and identifies "the best practical allocation" for investment portfolios. Using these two sound approaches for guiding investment decision-making, behavioral biases are incorporated into the portfolio management process</li> <li>Uses updated cases studies to show investors and financial advisors how an investor's behavior can be modified to improve investment decision-making</li> <li>Provides useable methods for creating behaviorally modified investment portfolios, which may help investors to reach their long term financial goals</li> <li>Heightens awareness of biases so that financial decisions and resulting economic outcomes are improved</li> <li>Offers advice on managing the effects of each bias in order to improve investment results</li> </ul> <p>This <i>Second Edition</i> illustrates investors' behavioral biases in detail and offers financial advisors and their clients practical advice about how to apply the science of behavioral finance to improve overall investment decision making.</p></p><p><p>Behavioral Finance and Wealth Management</p> <p>How to Build Investment Strategies That Account for Investor Biases</p> <p>Since the first edition of Behavioral Finance and Wealth Management was published&#x2014;in the wake of the bursting of the technology bubble in 2000&#x2014;the world faced yet another economic crisis in 2008. Accompanying this crisis is a new level of market volatility, and both investors and advisors can benefit from a deeper understanding of behavioral finance and how it can help them achieve their long-term financial goals. That's why author Michael Pompian, a wealth manager and practitioner at the forefront of the practical application of behavioral finance, has written the second edition of this book.</p> <p>As an investment advisor, Pompian understands the behavioral biases that investors have. He has discovered specific ways to adjust investment strategies for these biases and in the Second Edition of Behavioral Finance and Wealth Management, Pompian helps investors and their advisors develop a heightened awareness of these biases so that financial decisions, and resulting economic outcomes, can be improved.</p> <p>Divided into six comprehensive parts, this reliable guide opens with an introduction to the basics of behavioral finance, focusing on the aspects most relevant to individual wealth management. From here, Parts Two (Belief Perseverance Biases), Three (Information Processing Biases), and Four (Emotional Biases) define and illustrate a total of twenty of the most important biases&#x2014;within the cognitive-emotional framework&#x2014;for considering potential biases. For each of the twenty biases, Pompian uses the same basic format in discussing the bias, in order to promote greater accessibility.</p> <p>After covering the foundations of behavioral finance, the biases, Part Five turns to the main focus of this book: practical application of behavioral finance for investors and advisors. This section establishes a basic framework for integrating behavioral finance insights into portfolio structure and presents the concept of best practical allocation. It then takes the concepts presented and applies them in a case study format to reinforce learning.</p> <p>Rounding out this detailed discussion, Part Six ties together many of the concepts covered in the book and introduces a new concept Pompian has developed to make behavioral finance easier to apply in practice. The idea of Behavioral Investor Types (BITs) is introduced along with the investment biases that are associated with each one.</p> <p>Updated to reflect current market conditions, this reliable resource skillfully illustrates investors' behavioral biases in detail and offers financial advisors and their clients practical advice about how to apply the science of behavioral finance to improve overall investment decision making.</p><p>Praise for the first edition of Behavioral Finance and Wealth Management</p> <p>"Pompian is handing you the magic book, the one that reveals your behavioral flaws and shows you how to avoid them. The tricks to success are here. Read and do not stop until you are one of very few magicians." &#x2014;Arnold S. Wood, President and Chief Executive Officer, Martingale Asset Management</p> <p>"I wish this book had been available a decade ago; by understanding behavioral biases, clients and professionals can stay focused and comfortable throughout the markets' bubbles and doldrums. Michael Pompian moves our profession forward by proposing a standardized structure for this approach." &#x2014;Elizabeth K. Miller, CFA, Managing Director, Trevor Stewart Burton &amp; Jacobsen Inc., and former chair, New York Society of Security Analysts' Wealth Management Committee</p> <p>"Many inefficiencies in the market are the result of how investors let their emotions dictate their investment decisions. Michael Pompian's work provides a framework to understand why these inefficiencies exist, and how they can provide investors with significant profit-making opportunities." &#x2014;Stanley G. Lee, CFA, Principal, David J. Greene &amp; Company, LLC</p> <p>"Michael Pompian has created a valuable resource for investors and those in the wealth management community by not only explaining a number of important behavioral biases, but also giving them actionable steps to reduce biases and improve investment performance." &#x2014;John M.

Focusing on strategic analysis, value creation, and implementation, this book provides a rigorous grounding in essential principles while offering up-to-date perspectives based on practices used at leading companies across industries and borders. Comprehensive coverage merges theory and application through new and updated cases, and the discussion surrounding business policy, business strategy, and the business environment links concept to context for a holistic understanding of the mechanisms at work.<br><br> To keep pace with the field&#x2019;s constant evolution, this new edition has been revised to reflect the current business landscape with expanded coverage of critical topics including disruption, innovation, technology, and other factors impacting strategic planning and implementation.

Schoenherr describes the natural history of California&#x2014;a state with a greater range of landforms, a greater variety of habitats, and more kinds of plants and animals than any area of equivalent size in all of North America. <i>A Natural History of California</i> focuses on each distinctive region,&nbsp;addressing its climate, rocks, soil, plants, and animals.<br> &nbsp;<br> The second edition of this classic work features updated species names and taxa, new details about parks reclassified by federal and state agencies, new stories about modern human and animal interaction, and a new epilogue on the impacts of climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;An impressive compendium of the state&#x2019;s landforms, habitats, species, and conservation issues.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Sierra</i><br><br> &#x201c;One suspects that Allan Schoenherr&#x2019;s book will be regarded as the publishing equivalent of the Sierra Nevada mountains&#x2014;unique, conspicuous, a major landmark.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i><br><br> &#x201c;Allan Schoenherr&#x2019;s accomplishment takes us back to heroic times when <i>individuals</i> dared to write multivolume encyclopedias alone, discovered the &#x2018;laws&#x2019; of plant and animal distribution for an entire continent, or compiled keys, drawings, and descriptions for more than 5000 species in an area as large and complex as California.

How can we distinguish it from theology on the one hand and the psychology/sociology of religious belief on the other? What does it mean to describe God as "eternal"? And should religious people want there to be good arguments for the existence of God, or is religious belief only authentic in the absence of these good arguments?<br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Tim Bayne introduces the field of philosophy of religion, and engages with some of the most burning questions that philosophers discuss. Considering how "religion" should be defined, and whether we even need to be able to define it in order to engage in the philosophy of religion, he goes on to discuss whether the existence of God matters. Exploring the problem of evil, Bayne also debates the connection between faith and reason, and the related question of what role reason should play in religious contexts. Shedding light on the relationship between science and religion, Bayne finishes by considering the topics of reincarnation and the afterlife.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

First Year Polish is intended for use in both high school and college courses and for individualized instruction. The book is written for persons with little or no previous language-learning experience. Attention is paid to speaking, reading, writing, and listening. The language is based upon that of contemporary Poland; grammar is presented explicitly but is well spread throughout the book. Every effort is made to avoid grammar burnout: topics found to be easier for English-speaking learners are placed earlier. The thirty lessons vary between conversation and reading. Each lesson is generously supplied with pattern drills and sentences for translation. The book is richly illustrated. Most lessons can realistically be covered in a single week of non intensive classroom study.</p><p></p><h2>Of Hospitality (Cultural Memory in the Present)</h2><p>These two lectures by Jacques Derrida, "Foreigner Question" and "Step of Hospitality/No Hospitality," derive from a series of seminars on "hospitality" conducted by Derrida in Paris, January 1996. His seminars, in France and in America, have become something of an institution over the years, the place where he presents the ongoing evolution of his thought in a remarkable combination of thoroughly mapped-out positions, sketches of new material, and exchanges with students and interlocutors. As has become a pattern in Derrida's recent work, the form of this presentation is a self-conscious enactment of its content. The book consists of two texts on facing pages. "Invitation" by Anne Dufourmantelle appears on the left (an invitation that of course originates in a response), clarifying and inflecting Derrida's "response" on the right. The interaction between them not only enacts the "hospitality" under discussion, but preserves something of the rhythms of teaching. The volume also characteristically combines careful readings of canonical texts and philosophical topics with attention to the most salient events in the contemporary world, using "hospitality" as a means of rethinking a range of political and ethical situations. "Hospitality" is viewed as a question of what arrives at the borders, in the initial surprise of contact with an other, a stranger, a foreigner. For example, Antigone is revisited in light of the question of impossible mourning; <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i> is read via concerns that also apply to teletechnology; the trial of Socrates is brought into conjunction with the televised funeral of Fran�ois Mitterrand.</p><p>&#x201c;Of Hospitality provides us with a glimpse of Jacques Derrida as not only the brilliant thinker and writer readers have long admired but as the masterful lecturer and pedagogue his students have long known. . . . Of Hospitality should find a welcome audience not only among faithful readers of Derrida but among all those who are open enough to hear the knock at their borders or their doors.&#x201d;&#x2014;L&#x2019;Esprit Cr�ateur<br>&#x201c;Both lectures [in the book] deserve credit not only for representing a significant step in Derrida&#x2019;s reflection on ethics and politics but also for prompting us to begin our own deconstructive work and rethink our identity.&#x201d;&#x2014;SymplokeJacques Derrida was Director of Studies at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris, and Professor of Humanities at the University of California, Irvine. Stanford has published eight of his books, most recently a joint publication of <i>The Instant of My Death</i> (Maurice Blanchot) and <i>Demeure: Fiction and Testimony</i> (Derrida).

They also have difficulty shifting from an individualistic view to one of seeing interactions and systems. How do therapists hone their own methods with all of these choices? And how do they learn how to best treat families with all of the focus being taken away from their clients and redirected instead on processes? Perhaps most importantly, how can they learn through an inductive process of exploring what has occurred during the therapeutic session? <br>Veteran therapist and founder of Structural Family Therapy, Salvador Minuchin, goes back to basics with his two co-authors Michael D. Reiter and Charmaine Borda in <em>The Craft of Family Therapy</em>. In this book they teach readers basic communication and family therapy skills using some of Dr. Minuchin&#x2019;s most interesting and illuminating cases. Not only do readers re-learn basic techniques, such as reframing and joining, but they are treated to an in-depth commentary on each case, with Dr. Minuchin emphasizing the techniques he uses that allow him to refocus attention from the&nbsp;Identified Patient to the family as a whole. The book ends with three supervision transcripts from Dr. Minuchin&#x2019;s students, whose commentary illuminates the struggles, fears, and insecurities that new family therapists face and how they can overcome them.

His thrilling account culminates with their final concert at Altamont Speedway&#x2014;a nightmare of beating, stabbing, and killing that would signal the end of a generation&#x2019;s dreams of peace and freedom. But while this book renders in fine detail the entire history of the Stones, paying special attention to the tragedy of Brian Jones, it is about much more than a writer and a rock band. It has been called&#x2014;by Harold Brodkey and Robert Stone, among others&#x2014;the best book ever written about the sixties. In Booth&#x2019;s new afterword, he finally explains why it took him 15 years to write the book, relating an astonishing story of drugs, jails, and disasters.<br></p><p>s won acclaim nationwide as a masterpiece not only of rock journalism but of harrowing social history as well.

It shows how images can be built up easily, from initial geometric shapes right through to the finished trees. Denis Naylor includes a good selection of popular species such as Weeping Cherry in Blossom, Oak, Eucalyptus, Aspen in Autumn and many, many more. He also shows you how to draw tree details such as roots, cones and trunks. He uses a helpful two-colour method that clearly shows every line and curve of the step-by-step pictures. Even absolute beginners will find themselves creating great drawings when they use this book and there is much to inspire more experienced artists too. An invaluable guide for anyone interested in this subject.</p><p>Denis John-Naylor studied Natural History Illustration at Bournemouth College of Art and Wildlife Painting at Swansea Institute. He is a self-employed consultant and a part-time teacher of watercolour, pencil, acrylic and oil painting in adult education. His hobbies include plein air painting, reading biographies and listening to music.Denis John Naylor suggests that by improving your drawing of trees, you will improve your ability to draw other subjects. Denis shows how to reduce the tree to basic shapes as well as how to look at your subject more carefully. Trees of all kinds are included, from flowering and fruiting trees, to trees at different times of the year, with and without leaves.-Leisure Painter If you draw landscapes or anything with an outdoors background you are sure to want to include trees. This latest entry in Search Press&#39; popular How To Draw series shows you how to draw them. Not only trees either but features of them such as bark, roots, leaves, cones and a stump. Choose from a variety of different shapes such as oak, laburnum, Lombardy poplar, Jeffrey pine and wellingtonia (no palms, rather oddly). They are shown in spring laden with blossom, in full leaf in winter, displaying autumn tints and bare in winter. As with all the titles in this series the author devotes one page at the front of the book to tell you how to use the book and this is where you find the all-important index, for there is no identification on the pages themselves. Each page has a tree or some aspects of one rendered down to five stages. This takes the beginner artist from a rough outline through to an outline sketch, which is filled in first with pencil and finally in color using acrylics. The first five steps are easy to tackle and take much of the mystery out of what most people will agree is a tricky subject, but I would personally like to see more stages (at least one) showing how the color was added. I can see that this would make for a bigger, more expensive book so perhaps part of the learning curve is tackling this part on one&#39;s own. This is one of the best entries in this useful series, and destined for my own keeper shelf.-Myshelf.com As the title suggests this is a basic guide ideal for beginners. It shows how to draw a variety of trees including Oak, Horse Chestnut, Monterey Cypress and Eucalyptus. What is provided are a range of simple, easy to copy outlines which you can trace or draw to give you the images you require. A step by step technique is used to show how to develop an outline into the finished product, as well as an indication as to the colours and shading needed to bring it alive. An unusual aspect of this type of book is the fact that the author has gone beyond just drawing trees to include flowering trees and how to create blossom. Intricate tree details such as roots, leaves, cones and trunks are also included.-Monstersandcritics.com</p><h2>The Colt 1911 Pistol (Weapon)</h2><p><p>First used in combat during the Punitive Expedition into Mexico and then extensively during both World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945), the Colt Government Model (1911) pistol remained the standard issue handgun in the US armed forces for nearly 80 years and has continued in service with some units to this day. In fact, the M1911 has seen a resurgence among US Special Operations units, as US Marine MARSOC and MEUSOC personnel are issued current generation 1911-type pistols. </p><p>In addition, the pistol has seen service with famous law enforcement agencies such as the Shanghai Municipal Police, LAPD Swat and Texas Rangers. Nearly a century after its introduction, the M1911 Pistol remains a popular design and is now produced by virtually every major firearms manufacturer doing business in the USA.</p><p>In this new volume, handgun expert Leroy Thompson sheds new light on the development, history and use of this revolutionary handgun, complete with specially-commissioned artwork depicting the firing process and cutaway profile of the gun, as well as its use in various theaters of war.</p></p><p>Leroy Thompson trained and advised military and police special operations units around the world focusing especially on the tactical use of firearms. He has previously had 38 books published and more recent titles include The Hostage Rescue Manual, The Counterinsurgency Manual and Secret Techniques of the Elite Forces. He has also had various firearms books published including Great Combat Handguns. He has also appeared as an weapons expert on documentaries for Discovery, National Geographic and the BBC.&#x201c;Author Leroy Thompson tells us the story of the Model 1911 from its inception to today's use. This includes all of the different variations and improvements made to the gun in the last 100 years. It is truly staggering the number of types made and the huge number of places and companies who made these pistols. It all makes for another superb book and if you are interested in weapons, then this book is very much a must have.

He is an engaging, experienced guide who reveals the development of modern yoga through the centuries and shows how the ancient yogis did it. <br><br>Each section offers a guided practice session of ancient poses and breathing techniques to enable readers to connect to the roots of their yoga and to provide a framework for understanding the sequences they use in their regular sessions.</p><p>Richard Rosen is a graduate of the Iyengar Institute of San Francisco and has been teaching yoga since 1987.

Butler, and Gene Wolfe, and including an original story by Jerry Oltion ('Judgment Passed'), this title belongs in most sf or short fiction collections. --Library Journal<br><br>Wastelands is an exceptional anthology. In scope and vision it can only be compared to Harlan Ellison-s Dangerous Visions. Like that famed anthology, Wastelands collects some of the best stories of a genre, each with an introduction by the editor that sets the stage for the events that unfold. The stories are full of depth, but are also so well crafted that they are not preachy. None of the stories will disappoint the reader who picks up this anthology. ...<br><br>I highly recommend this anthology for anyone who enjoys reading anything. A lot of these authors I had not read before and I now want to seek out their novels at the bookstore. Each story is unique, and while all share the same basic frame, each writer has been able to pull a completely different conclusion about or assessment of humanity. Some are chilling while others are hopeful, but each will show the reader a facet of himself or herself if they are willing to see it. Wastelands: Stories of the Apocalypse is the best anthology of any kind I have read to date. --Grasping for the Wind</p><h2>Nicholas St. North and the Battle of the Nightmare King (1) (The Guardians)</h2><p><b>Don't miss <i>The Rise of the Guardians</i>, soon to be a major motion picture in theaters November 2012.</b><br><br>Before SANTA was SANTA, he was North, Nicholas St. North&#x2014;a daredevil swordsman whose prowess with double scimitars was legendary. Like any swashbuckling young warrior, North seeks treasure and adventure, leading him to the fiercely guarded village of Santoff Claussen, said to be home to the greatest treasure in all the East, and to an even greater wizard, Ombric Shalazar.

William Joyce interviews the future Mr. Claus about his past, the other Guardians, and what he thinks of the cast of colorful characters that live at the North Pole.</b> <br><br> <p><b>William Joyce:</b> When you were younger, where did you think you'd end up?</p><p> <b>Nicholas St. North:</b> Well, they didn't have Las Vegas when I was a kid. Or Disney World, so those just weren't an option. I'm kidding. KIDDING. But the North Pole? Never saw myself there.</p><p> <b>Joyce:</b> How do you think you came across in my telling of your story?</p><p> <b>Nick St. North:</b> Much better than I expected, to be honest, and since I'm Santa Claus I am, you know, I'm always honest. Your portrayal of me is you know, balanced. You got the good me and the ... wild me. I'm certainly jolly and you caught that. And the temper thing ... you didn't shy away from that. And the bravery and the fun. The fun me. I liked that. Because I'm, you know, fun. FUN! A fun guy.</p><p> <b>Joyce:</b> Could you tell us a little about the Guardians of Childhood?</p><p> <b>Nick St. North:</b> Great group. The best. Really. So glad to be a member. Sandman, Man in the Moon, Tooth Fairy, the Egg guy, that Frost kid ... just terrific. We all have our own thing, but we work together very, very well. Fighting the Boogeyman, Pitch is his real name. Not many people know that. But, yeah, I think we do a lotta good work together. </p><p> <b>Joyce:</b> Which Guardian would you choose to stand beside you in the thick of battle?</p><p> <b>Nick St. North:</b> Oh ... now. That's, that's, you know ... They are <em>all</em>, ALL great in their own way. All so talented. Geniuses! I mean it! Even, you know, the egg guy.</p><p> <b>Joyce:</b>What do you think makes you such a great Guardian?</p><p> <b>Nick St. North:</b> Oh, that's ... No ... I can't ... you're so kind ... Look, I just try to be the best Santa I can be. Firm. Friendly, but fair. That's sort of the motto.</p><p> <b>Joyce:</b> If you had a chance to change one thing in your past, would you? What would it be?</p><p> <b>Nick St. North:</b> You know, I ... Can we just not go there?</p><p> <b>Joyce:</b> If you could learn one bug or animal language, what would it be?</p><p> <b>Nick St. North:</b> Gosh. I know almost all of them. That's how I get a lot of my info on the naughty or nice thing. Pets are usually very reliable for that. I speak fluent hamster, which is good, because hamsters, they know EVERYTHING. I even speak leech. Which isn't much help really. There are some Irish accents I have trouble with. I love how they sound, but I need subtitles if it's a movie. And the Jersey Shore kids. Can't understand a word.</p><p> <b>Joyce:</b> How are the elves to work with?</p><p> <b>Nick St. North:</b> Well, we are all old, old friends. We've known each other since day one. But, honestly, I wish they were a little taller.</p><p> <b>Joyce:</b> Taller, you say?</p><p> <b>Nick St. North:</b> Yes. They get stepped on A LOT. Especially by the Yeti. It gets messy.</p><p> <b>Joyce:</b> Yeti? You mean Abominable Snowmen?</p><p> <b>Nick St. North:</b> "Abominable" is not the preferred designation. As native Himalayans, they prefer "Yeti" or Abominable Snowperson.</p><p> <b>Joyce:</b> So you have Abominable Snowpersons working at the North Pole?</p><p> <b>Nick St. North:</b> Oh yes! They actually do most of the toy development and construction. Which I am still, like, amazed by. I mean their fingers are huge, HUGE. Big as bean bag chairs. But they can do detail work! All the little stuff--eyes on dolls, you name it. They're also awesome warriors, super tidy and excellent at baking. Their cookies? Outta control and Low Cal. </p><p> <b>Joyce:</b> What about the elves? They don&#x2019;t do toys?</p><p> <b>Nick St. North:</b> No, no, no, no. That's a huge misconception. The elves just play with the toys as sort of market testing ... to see if they're, you know, fun. Otherwise they're just sort of custodial ... sweeping, mopping. Oh! And they do party decorations and caroling. 20,000 elves singing 'Oh, Christmas Tree'? I get teary just talking about it.</p><p> <b>Joyce:</b> What do you think would have happened to you if you weren't chosen to be a Guardian?</p><p> <b>Nick St. North:</b> Definitely not retail or politics. They're too, too, I don't know ... pushy. I've always liked gardening. Landscape architect? Or social work? Or maybe directing. Features only. No TV.</p><p> <b>Joyce:</b> How would you most like to be remembered?</p><p> <b>Nick St. North:</b> Probably the whole Christmas Day thing. And my work with reindeer. Proud of that. And the kids.

When you've read his no-nonsense account of how he invented the World Wide Web, you'll want to thank him again, for the sheer coolness of his ideas. One day in 1980, Berners-Lee, an Oxford-trained computer consultant, got a random thought: "Suppose all the information stored on computers everywhere were linked?" So he created a system to give every "page" on a computer a standard address (now called a URL, or Universal Resource Locator), accessible via the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), formatted with the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and visible with the first browser, which did the trick of linking us all up.<p> He may be the most self-effacing genius of the computer age, and his egalitarian mind is evident in the names he rejected for his invention: "I thought of Mine of Information, or MOI, but <i>moi</i> in French means 'me,' and that was too egocentric.... The Information Mine (TIM) was even more egocentric!" Also, a mine is a passive repository; the Web is something that grows inexorably from everyone's contributions. Berners-Lee fully credits the colorful characters who helped him get the bobsled of progress going--one colleague times his haircuts to match the solstices--but he's stubbornly independent-minded. His quest is to make the Web "a place where the whim of a human being and the reasoning of a machine coexist in an ideal, powerful mixture."</p><p> Hard-core tech types may wish Berners-Lee had gone into deeper detail about the road ahead: the "boon and threat" of XML, free vs. commercial software, VRML 3-D imaging, and such. But he wants everyone in on the debate, so he wrote a brisk book that virtually anyone can understand. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the Web, is currently the director of theWorld Wide Web Consortium, the coordinating body for Web development, and heoccupies the 3Com Founders chair at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science.Recipient of numerous awards, he received the distinguished MacArthurFellowship in 1998.

Greene has taken one of the most venerable and revered texts of all times -The Bhagavad Gita, and presents it in a completely new way. Greene reveals that the GIta, which can easily be obtuse to the modern reader, is really a simple conversation between two friends about the meaning of life. This fresh new view helps the 21st century seeker relate to the Gita and offers new ways of understanding this essential wisdom. The Gita is a discussion between Krishna and his devoted friend Arjuna on a battlefield known as Kurukshetra, a sprawling tract of land two hours north of Delhi, India. Scriptural calculations put the date of this famous discussion at around 3000 BCE. Like all great literature the Gita explores the human condition: who we are, where we come from, and why we are here. And as with all great literature, the more we study the main characters the more real and human they become. From related works we learn that Krishna and Arjuna played together as children. They were close friends in youth and became family when Arjuna married Krishna&#x2019;s sister. We learn that later in life they shared extraordinary adventures, including a journey through subtle pathways to places outside the known universe. Plainly put, India&#x2019;s most revered scripture is a heart-to-heart talk between two men who were closer than brothers and were the best of friends. Above all, The Sacred Conversation is practical and features a very helpful glossary in the back for terms, names, and places. Whether you are an expert on The Bhagavad Gita or a first-time reader, this unique contribtion to spiritual literature offers deep knowledge in a highly accessible way.</p><p>Joshua M.

The slavers of the Empire guided the line, shoving their cargo forward with harsh commands and the occasional warning crack of a whip.</p><p>She had already exchanged farewells with her mother and siblings. Each had embraced her, dry-eyed and grim-faced. This wasn&#x2019;t their first parting, and for good or ill, it wouldn&#x2019;t be their last.</p><p>Her eldest brother, Nylan, squeezed her shoulder. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be waiting for you in the usual spot,&#x201d; he said in low tones meant for only her to hear. Gilene nodded, reaching up to pat his hand.</p><p>Her eyebrows arched when her mother sidled a little closer, her fingertips brushing Gilene&#x2019;s sleeve in a hesitant caress. &#x201c;Come back to us when it&#x2019;s over.&#x201d;</p><p>Gilene kept her reply behind her teeth. It was never over. Not for her. Despite her mother&#x2019;s half-hearted gesture of comfort, she wouldn&#x2019;t defend her daughter. Gilene would endure this every year until her age and her scars crippled her so badly, she could no longer wield her magic well enough to fool the Empire, and her burden became another&#x2019;s. Her resentment served to blunt her fear. She gave a quick nod before turning her back on her family and striding toward the line of captives.</p><p>People hemmed either side of the dusty road. Their gazes, as she walked past them, were fearful, hopeful. Ashamed. A few villagers, however, wore expressions of warning instead of pity on their faces.</p><p>Yes, come back to us, they seemed to say. Or else.</p><p>Their stares shifted briefly past her shoulder to where her family huddled together to watch her leave.</p><p>Not all shackles were fashioned of iron.</p><p>Some of the villagers reached out to touch her, their fingers drifting across her sleeves or skirts like dead leaves. Gilene shrugged them off and made her way to the motley group at the end of the path.</p><p>One of the slavers snarled an impatient &#x201c;Get in line!&#x201d; and shoved her to the end of the queue. A few of the women stared at her empty-eyed; others wept and wiped their noses on the backs of dirty hands, their chains rattling as they raised their arms.</p><p>Another slaver approached her, a pair of manacles dangling from his fingers. He gave her a black-toothed smile as he snapped them around her wrists and tethered her to the woman next to her.</p><p>&#x201c;Pretty jewelry,&#x201d; he said and shook the shackles to show there was no breaking them.</p><p>The vision of the slaver enrobed in flames and shrieking in agony almost made her smile, but she kept her expression blank and dropped her shoulders in a defeated sag. She had learned years earlier that a broken captive didn&#x2019;t incite the whip as often as a rebellious one did.</p><p>Beroe was the last stop on the slavers&#x2019; annual route to retrieve the living tithe the Krael Empire imposed on its subjects for the annual celebration known as the Rites of Spring. Gilene was the last tithe to join the others before they set off for the capital of Kraelag. She settled into the lurching rhythm of the chained line, dreading the four-day march ahead of her and its final destination even more.</p><p>Except for the chain rattle of shuffling feet and the bark of orders from a slaver, all stayed silent, fearful of the stinging flick of the whip.</p><p>Their journey was as miserable as it had been the previous year and the year before that: relentless marching under a spring sun that beat down on them with the promise of a brutal summer, nights spent huddled together for warmth as the remnants of winter rolled in with the twilight and whittled through clothing and skin like a knife.</p><p>The night before they reached the capital, Gilene curled into the back of her chain mate, a prostitute named Pell, and closed her eyes to the lullaby of chattering teeth and the soft sobs of her fellow prisoners. Her feet throbbed, but she dared not remove her sandals for fear of peeling away layers of skin from the many blisters.</p><p>She smelled the city&#x2019;s reek long before she saw it. When the great walled capital of the Krael Empire came into view, some of the women cried out their relief at the sight. The slavers laughed, yanking on the chains hard enough to make some of their captives stumble and fall. Gilene helped a fallen Pell to her feet before the man fondest of bestowing the whip&#x2019;s kiss strode toward them. Her fingers burned hot, earning a startled look from the prostitute before Gilene let go and stepped away as far as her chain length allowed. She forced down her fury before the tiny sparks bouncing between her knuckles grew to flames.</p><p>Patience, she silently admonished herself.</p><p>The slavers herded the women onto a wide, paved road that led to the colossal main gates. The space around them disappeared as they were hemmed in by a milling throng of people, carts, and animals. The noise was deafening, and the combined smells of sewage and unwashed bodies made her eyes water. She lifted her hands to cover her nose, the clink of her chains lost in the cacophony of shouting people, bleating livestock, and creaking wagon wheels as the masses heaved and rocked toward the gates.</p><p>Guards perched at their watches high in the two towers flanking either side of the gates, idly watching the crowd as it squeezed its way into the city&#x2019;s confines&#x2014;many who had come to attend the Rites of Spring. They casually dropped garbage and other offal on people as they passed beneath them, their raucous laughter carried on the fetid breeze.</p><p>A guard leaned out of a tower and shouted down to the crowd. &#x201c;Any pretty flowers this year, Dolsh?&#x201d;</p><p>The slaver closest to Gilene yelled back. &#x201c;Does it matter? One roasted hen looks much like another.&#x201d;</p><p>Laughter followed his reply, along with faint weeping. Gilene growled under her breath. A roasted cockerel looked like any other as well. She wanted to burn them all, every last one of them, but she was only one woman with limited power, a power she&#x2019;d drain to the dregs just so she could survive this madness and keep her compatriots from suffering.</p><p>They were whipped, shoved, and cuffed through the narrow closes that branched off the main road like strands on a debris-littered spiderweb. At the web&#x2019;s center, a man-made hill rose, its top crested with the emperor&#x2019;s palace. Temples, manors, and bathhouses marched up its sides, and at its base, the arena crouched. A circular, roofless amphitheater whose sole purpose was to entertain Kraelag&#x2019;s citizens with blood sport and brutality, it was known as the Pit, and to it the slavers herded their charges.</p><p>They reached the Pit&#x2019;s outer walls and an entrance closed off by a barred gate manned by more guards. The sunlight faded as the procession descended several flights of slippery steps, through passages dimly lit by torchlight. The walls narrowed, forcing everyone into a single line. All snaked through the labyrinthine maze until they reached a low-ceilinged chamber in the city&#x2019;s catacombs.</p><p>Gilene inhaled a stuttered breath as she crossed the threshold, knowing what awaited them in the chamber. Fresh from the Pit, covered in gore and reeking of sweat and butchery, the gladiators of the Empire lounged at the chamber&#x2019;s opposite end and eyed the newcomers.</p><p>They didn&#x2019;t approach, but the weight of their leers pressed down on her as she and the other women huddled together. She pretended not to see them. These were the men who had survived the day&#x2019;s games, and their reward would be the sacrificial victims known as the Flowers of Spring. As one of those unfortunate blooms, Gilene would whore for her village tonight and burn for it tomorrow.</p><p>The girl on the other side of Pell shuddered and chanted a desperate prayer in a foreign tongue. Gilene leaned past her chain mate and grabbed a stretch of links attached to the praying girl&#x2019;s manacle, giving it a quick jerk. The girl gasped, prayer forgotten as she stared wide-eyed first at Pell, then at Gilene.</p><p>&#x201c;Shhh,&#x201d; Gilene instructed her in a soft voice. &#x201c;Be still. Be silent. Some lust for beauty, others for fear. Don&#x2019;t show them yours.&#x201d;</p><p>The other woman nodded, her lips moving in a now-soundless chant. Gilene gave her a brief smile of approval. She could offer little else, at least for tonight.</p><p>Pell leaned down to whisper in Gilene&#x2019;s ear. &#x201c;Her prayers are in vain. She&#x2019;s too pretty, even under all the dirt. She should pray the one who chooses her will be gentle.&#x201d; Her words were blunt rather than merciless.</p><p>Gilene sighed. &#x201c;Gentleness has little meaning when one is unwilling.&#x201d; She stared at Pell, wondering at the woman&#x2019;s practical calm. Gilene had made this horrific trip four times before this one. She knew what to expect. The only unknown was how terrible each year would be compared to the one before it. &#x201c;What will you pray for, Pell?&#x201d;</p><p>The slattern&#x2019;s calculating smile deepened the lines around her mouth and those fanning the corners of her kohl-lined eyes. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t prayed in years, girl. Wouldn&#x2019;t know how to go about it even if I tried. I&#x2019;ll be happy to get one of those fine stallions with the blood washed off him and enough skill between the blankets to make it worth spreading my legs for free.&#x201d;</p><p>Gilene admired Pell&#x2019;s bravado. The woman knew what awaited her with the dawn yet still held on to a cynical wit.</p><p>Pell made to say more but stopped when a short, muscled bull of a man strode into the chamber. Dressed in mismatched armor and carrying both whip and dagger, he was a formidable sight. Blue markings decorated his skin, sleeving his bare arms. The marks curled over his shoulders and crept up a thick neck to cap his bald head. Some of the women in line cowered away from him, and he grinned.</p><p>Hanimus, gladiatorial master trainer, still presided over this event each year with relish. Like Pell, Gilene didn&#x2019;t pray, but if she did, she&#x2019;d beseech the gods for Hanimus&#x2019;s death. He represented all that was rotten about the Empire.</p><p>He walked the long row of women, pausing at times to lift the chin of one with his whip handle or fondle the breast of another. His fighters called out encouragement and vulgar suggestions for what they wanted to do to their chosen prizes.</p><p>&#x201c;They sent us a good crop this year, lads,&#x201d; he proclaimed. &#x201c;Too bad you only have them for a night.&#x201d; Groans and ribald laughter filled the room, drowning out the softer weeping.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll all grow old before we can choose,&#x201d; one impatient fighter protested.</p><p>The trainer&#x2019;s eyes narrowed, and he spun to glare at the men. They snapped to attention. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll wait your turn,&#x201d; he warned. &#x201c;Azarion is still fighting. If he lives, he&#x2019;ll have first choice as Prime.&#x201d;</p><p>As if on cue, the boisterous cheers of the arena&#x2019;s crowd vibrated against the stone walls of the catacombs, sending dust raining down on everyone&#x2019;s heads. The death bell pealed a sonorous song&#x2014;tribute to the victor, a dirge to the slain.</p><p>&#x201c;Lot of good it&#x2019;ll do him,&#x201d; someone muttered. &#x201c;Herself will summon him like always. She rides that cock every chance she gets.&#x201d; A chorus of ayes answered him.</p><p>Hanimus shrugged. &#x201c;He still has first pick.&#x201d;</p><p>Gilene bowed her head to hide her anger. Most of the women in chains had been separated from husbands and children, parents and siblings. Brought to Kraelag for the sole purpose of dying, they shouldn&#x2019;t have to suffer this final degradation.</p><p>A part of her recognized they were alike in some ways&#x2014;the condemned women of the villages and the enslaved gladiators of the arena. They had once been beloved sons and brothers, maybe husbands and fathers. Now they were all fodder for indifferent gods and the entertainment of the Empire, their deaths more valuable than their lives to those who ruled. Still, she couldn&#x2019;t find it within her to pity these men who would subjugate them.</p><p>An expectant silence descended on the group as the crowd&#x2019;s triumphant chant swelled to a thunderous bellow.</p><p>&#x201c;Azarion! Azarion! Azarion!&#x201d;</p><p>Hanimus smacked his whip handle against his thigh and grinned. &#x201c;Ha! I knew he&#x2019;d take the fight. The Margrave of Southland owes me a goodly sum now.&#x201d;</p><p>The march of feet soon sounded on the steps leading down to the catacombs&#x2014;the last victorious gladiator and his entourage of guards. Gilene watched the doorway from the corner of her eye, her stomach knotting itself in dread of seeing the man who would come through the entrance.</p><p>Like the other gladiators already here, he&#x2019;d be dressed in blood-spattered armor. Unlike the others, he&#x2019;d suck the air out of the room with his presence. She remembered Azarion from her previous annual treks to the capital. Worse, Azarion seemed to remember her.</p><p>Boot heels scraped across the dirt, and the Gladius Prime made his appearance. He bent to avoid hitting the lintel and entered the chamber. Stifled gasps from the women and bows from the men greeted him&#x2014;this slave who commanded the deference reserved for kings.</p><p>He&#x2019;d changed little since she&#x2019;d seen him the previous year. A tall, solidly built man with wide shoulders and long, muscled arms, he exuded a presence that diminished the men around him. He was disarmed now, but she had no doubt he could kill as easily with his bare hands as he did with the weapons he carried into the arena.</p><p>His dark hair was shorter than she remembered, resting on his shoulders in sweat-dampened tendrils. She refused to look at him directly, choosing instead to watch him from the corner of her eye. She&#x2019;d met his gaze before and regretted it.</p><p>He was handsome, with the high cheekbones and light eyes characteristic of the nomadic clans who roamed the Stara Dragana. The cold expression he leveled on the room&#x2019;s occupants turned his green eyes flinty. Gilene hunched her shoulders and tucked herself as far back from the line as her chains allowed.</p><p>One of the gladiators broke the expectant silence. &#x201c;Was it a good fight, Azarion?&#x201d;</p><p>Azarion glanced at him before returning his attention to the women. &#x201c;Aye. Damiano fought well and died honorably.&#x201d;</p><p>Gilene shuddered. She&#x2019;d forgotten his voice. Low and gruff, it carried to all corners, challenging, as if he dared anyone to make light of his victory or the death of the man he&#x2019;d fought.</p><p>Hanimus tapped him on the arm. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been waiting for you. Best make your choice quick before Herself calls for you.&#x201d;</p><p>Azarion slowly moved down the line, and Gilene&#x2019;s heart joined her stomach in trying to squeeze itself into a corner of her rib cage. He paused before each woman, staring at her with a prolonged gaze. Beside Gilene, chains clanked as Pell patted down the snarled mess of her hair and adopted a pose to show off her attributes.</p><p>Gilene clenched her hands in her skirts, trying not to panic. Surely, he couldn&#x2019;t recognize her. She&#x2019;d returned to the capital time and again with a different face. Her skills with illusion were as refined as they were with fire. The slavers never knew they brought the same woman from Beroe to Kraelag year after year. No slave fighter from the Stara Dragana should have the talent to see past her veil of enchantment.</p><p>Fear coated her tong...</p></p><h2>Cirque Du Freak: Trials of Death: Book 5 in the Saga of Darren Shan (Cirque Du Freak, 5)</h2><p>The trials: seventeen ways to die unless the luck of the vampire is with you. Darren Shan must pass five fearsome Trials to prove himself to the vampires clan - or face the stakes of the Hall of Death. But Vampire Mountain holds hidden threats. Sinister, potent forces are gathering in the darkness. In this nightmarish world of bloodshed and betrayal, death may be a blessing...</p><p>Darren Shan is the New York Times bestselling author of Cirque Du Freak and The Demonata, whose novels have sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Darren lives in Ireland, where he writes and collects art, comics, and film.<br>Grade 4-7-This is the fifth novel in the continuing saga of the youthful half-vampire assistant to Larten Crepsley, a full vampire. Crepsley has brought Darren to Vampire Mountain to undergo the Trials of Death, an elective ritual periodically undergone by vampires in order to bond with the clan and prove their worth. As a half-vampire, Darren is in more danger of failing the trials than the others who usually participate, but he is determined to go ahead. The penalty for failing without dying is execution. In the background a new conflict looms, involving the vampaneze, purple-skinned killers who resemble vampires but who are nothing like the beings whom Darren has come to respect and admire. When it appears that he will not survive the trials, his vampire friends urge him to escape. Escorting him out through the mountain's underground tunnels, they run smack into an incoming vampaneze invasion. In the final pages, the plot and action finally pick up to fever pace as Darren is caught between invaders, defenders, and possibly a traitor in the ranks of the faithful. Characters are mostly one-dimensional, and the plot plods along until the final conflict heats up the action. Although the story stands on its own, there isn't much reason to read this one aside from following the series.<br><i>Susan L.

Where some of the colorful punk bands from the first half of the decade were loud, political, and uncompromising, their anarcho-punk counterparts were even more so, totally prepared to risk their liberty to communicate the ideals they believed in so passionately. With Crass and Poison Girls opening the floodgates, the arrival of bands such as Amebix, Chumbawamba, Flux of Pink Indians, and Zounds heralded a new age of honesty and integrity in underground music. New, exclusive interviews and hundreds of previously unreleased photographs document the impact of all of the scene&#x2019;s biggest names&#x2014;and a fair few of the smaller ones&#x2014;highlighting how anarcho-punk took the rebellion inherent in punk from the very beginning to a whole new level of personal awareness.</p></p><p><p><b>Ian Glasper</b> is a writer, the founder of the now-defunct Blackfish Records, which released 20 punk, hardcore, and metalcore albums, and a member of many DIY punk bands.

Collectively these and other works represent the best British progressive rock had to offer. Yet, it's Yes's 1972 three-track masterpiece, <i>Close to the Edge</i>, that presents a snapshot of an adventurous rock band at the peak of its powers, daring to push itself musically, both as individuals and as a unit. In this absorbing chronicle, which draws upon dozens of original and archived interviews and features rare photographs and an extensive discography, acclaimed music journalist Will Romano examines why <i>Close to the Edge</i> is the ultimate prog rock album.<br><br>Yes had previously penned epic tracks for <i>The Yes Album</i> and <i>Fragile</i>, but nothing on the magnitude of the musical gems appearing on <i>Close to the Edge</i>. It's something of a small miracle &#x2013; perhaps even magic &#x2013; that the virtuoso quintet crafted such a cohesive and compelling album during an often-hectic recording process that very nearly relegated this monumental work to the dustbin of history. So potent was the power of <i>Close to the Edge</i> that even before its release it had forever shifted the personal dynamics of the group and the course of progressive rock. Rarely had Yes, or any rock outfit for that matter, been simultaneously so expansive and concise, spiritual and savage, profound and nebulous.</p><p><b>Will Romano</b> (New York City) has written for such publications as the <i>New York Post</i>, <i>New York Daily News</i>, <i>Guitar Player</i>, <i>Modern Drummer</i>, <i>American Way</i>, and <i>PLSN</i>.

In God's redemptive plan, that goes without saying. But what about the reality of white normativity? This idea and way of being in the world has been parasitically joined to Christianity, and this is the ground of many of our problems today. It is time to redouble the efforts of the church and its institutions to muster well-informed, gospel-based initiatives to fight racialized injustice and overcome the heresy of whiteness. Written by a world-class roster of scholars, <em>Can &#x201c;White&#x201d; People Be Saved?</em> develops language to describe the current realities of race and racism. It challenges evangelical Christianity in particular to think more critically and constructively about race, ethnicity, migration, and mission in relation to white supremacy. Historical and contemporary perspectives from Africa and the African diaspora prompt fresh theological and missiological questions about place and identity. Native American and Latinx experiences of colonialism, migration, and hybridity inspire theologies and practices of shalom. And Asian and Asian American experiences of ethnicity and class generate transnational resources for responding to the challenge of systemic injustice. With their call for practical resistance to the Western whiteness project, the perspectives in this volume can revitalize a vision of racial justice and peace in the body of Christ.</p><p>Love L.

Beginning with the discourse around white supremacy, the book argues that the colonial mentality has invaded many other forms of Christianity around the globe such as: European Christians and indigenous peoples of the Americans, caste and race in India, and Asian Americans and affirmative action. This is a topic which Christians today&#x2015;especially evangelicals&#x2015;can no longer ignore." (Alexander Chow, senior lecturer in theology and world Christianity, School of Divinity, University of Edinburgh)<br><br>"As I read through this book (a compilation of papers from an important academic conference) my first response was, Why couldn&#x2019;t I have been there! For those of us who could not attend this dynamic and important gathering, we have the tremendous opportunity to interact with the significant findings from a meeting of some of the best scholars on this topic. The problem of race and its intersection with missiology continues to elude many in the American church. Told from multiple perspectives and voices arising from a myriad of experiences and expertise, this text will serve as a vital primer for those who seek a more profound understanding of race, theology, and mission." (Soong-Chan Rah, Milton B. Engebretson Professor of Church Growth and Evangelism, North Park Theological Seminary, author of The Next Evangelicalism and Prophetic Lament)<br><br>"This book brilliantly captures and elucidates one of the gravest and long-standing threats to Christianity: a theology fashioned in the idolatrous images of race, power, gender, ability, or nationalism. Zeroing in on whiteness as a concrete example of this kind of treacherous theology, the book teaches us how to smash such idols and let radical love, equality for all of God's children, and shared human dignity shine forth from our theologies and practices." (Nimi Wariboko, Walter G. Muelder Professor of Social Ethics, Boston University)<br><br>"The emphatically Christian voices in this important book explore the damage done to Christian witness by the tight bond between Western missionary activity and unreflective racist assumptions. While some particularly helpful contributors record parallel difficulties arising in other cultures, all pose a biblically based challenge to the aggressive nationalism, manipulative colonialism, and unthinking Enlightenment assumptions that long tainted Western missions activity. It is a sobering and thought-provoking book." (Mark Noll, coauthor, Clouds of Witnesses: Christian Voices from Africa and Asia)<br><br>"In a growing corpus of work on antiracism, <em>Can "White" People Be Saved?: Triangulating Race, Theology, and Mission</em> stands out at many levels. To begin with, it overcomes the tendency to engage the topic of racism as a black and white binary. The book includes a variety of outstanding scholars from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds, including evangelical or evang�lic@ perspectives such as Drs. Love Sechrest, Willie James Jennings, Andrea Smith, Elizabeth Conde-Frazier, and Amos Yong. Second, the book is distinctive from other books on antiracism in that it is profoundly theological, intentionally scriptural, and eminently praxeological. Third, given the recent climate of stridency and intolerance, it is refreshing to read a book that seeks not to demonize any one constituency but rather to bring fresh knowledge and understanding to key concepts (racism, white supremacy, whiteness, postcolonialism, etc.). It enables the reader to see how racism is above all a structural problem that impoverishes the church and the world it is called to serve. Finally, the book is unique in that its constructive dialogue about overcoming the deforming dis-ease of racism and white supremacy leads to a missiological paradigm shift, allowing missions to become truly life giving and Spirit filled. It is an important book that everyone who is committed to the biblical notions of justice and the reign of God should read and own." (Loida I. Martell, vice president of academic affairs, dean and professor of constructive theology, Lexington Theological Seminary, Lexington, Kentucky)<br><br>"In the series of essays found in <em>Can "White" People Be Saved?</em> an all-star lineup of Christian scholars thoroughly challenge many of the notions of nobility that have always accompanied modern mission and its racist entanglement with white supremacy. The issue is complex but not complicated. Seamlessly, the authors out the premise of current and past systemic racism enmeshed with Christian mission, and then disentangle the practices associated with whiteness and mission. The exposure of whiteness as normal, embedded in modern mission, is competently examined and exposed in <em>Can "White" People Be Saved?</em> How the church responds will answer the question." (Randy S. Woodley, author of Shalom and the Community of Creation)<br><br>"<em>Can "White" People Be Saved?: Triangulating Race, Theology, and Mission</em> is informed by a narrative historical timeline that traces and analyzes the study of race and racism. In an era where the relevance of church is increasingly called into question, this compilation of interdisciplinary essays is essential reading." (Angela D. Sims, author of Lynched: The Power of Memory in a Culture of Terror)<br><br>"It is obvious from this volume's chapters that the past quarter decade of 'racial reconciliation miracles' in and among evangelical and Pentecostal denominations and movements were hopeful gestures. The authors lay down clear signposts for the rocky paths Christians have trod, for the troubled crossroads evangelicals inhabit, and for the way of straightening still to be done in search of a beloved community. <em>Can "White" People Be Saved?</em> challenges readers to undertake a difficult but ultimately rewarding journey of introspection." (Daniel Ram�rez, author, Migrating Faith: Pentecostalism in the United States and Mexico in the Twentieth Century)<br><br>"Fuller's 2017 Missiology Lectures were for me an experience of a lifetime. I am thrilled that the talks presented are now available in one volume for a wider audience. The breadth, depth, and diversity of perspectives&#x2015;from North America, Latin America, Asia, and Africa&#x2015;and the interdisciplinary approach in tackling the complex issues around race, theology, and mission are highly commendable. The work not only diagnoses the evil of racism, with distortion of mission and damage to Christian witness, but also offers a positive vision of living out who God intended us to be&#x2015;community in the Holy Spirit&#x2015;by offering practical guidelines for deconstructing narratives of whiteness and blackness, racial superiority and inferiority. I am so thankful that part of the future is the end of modern mission as we have known it.<br><br>"For those of us whose skin pigmentation has been labeled black, we shall be delighted that finally the question is asked bluntly, Can "White" People Be Saved? These essays demand, however (without stating it explicitly), that we ask the corollary, Can "Black" People Be Saved? Both whiteness and blackness are 'demons' that ought to be exorcised for us to embrace God's salvation because as the essays articulate, any racial categorization renders some people outside of the category of human. <br><br>"I commend this volume in its entirety, not because it is infallible on matters of race and theology (for we know it is not) but because it models for us how as a people of God in this historical moment, in our diverse social locations, we may boldly confront, in love and with integrity, the distortions and deformations of the gospel inherent in the partiality and particularity of any location&#x2015;historical, cultural, racial, or otherwise." (D. Zac Niringiye, bishop emeritus of Kampala Diocese, Anglican Church of Uganda, senior fellow, Institute of Religion, Faith and Culture in Public Life)<br><br>"It is rare that a set of essays offers such consistently insightful theological material to help us grapple with Western ways of being and doing&#x2015;ways that many take for granted but that many more have shown to be sinful and destructive. These ways have been shaped by deeply ingrained and implicit assumptions that place whiteness&#x2015;both as phenotype and as culture&#x2015;as normative in our thoughts and actions. These thoughtful essays will help us navigate a way forward with integrity, sensitivity, and empathy for all."

That's the premise of <i>The Transparency Sale</i>, and I love it.<br>When it comes to B2B sales strategy, fashions have been shifting for decades. But whether we're supposed to form relationships, challenge people, sell solutions, or always be closing, one thing has been central.<br><br>The objective has been to convince people that what you're selling is a perfect match for what they need. Whether it actually is, is secondary. If you listen to Todd Caponi, that has to change.<br><br>Until last year, Caponi was chief revenue officer for PowerReviews, a company that provides online review capabilities to retailer sites. In that capacity, he noticed something fascinating: people are more willing to buy a product whose reviews are in the 4.2 to 4.5 star range than one with a perfect five-star rating.<br><br>Think about it. One five-star review is great. Only five star reviews? That's suspicious. All products have flaws. If you're like me, you start reading the negative reviews.

This does two things. First, it jolts people out of the usual sales resistance. And second, it makes them trust you. It turns out that honesty and integrity are effective sales strategies.<br><br>Why? Because our brains are designed to resist influence. As Todd Caponi writes, "The second the buyer's brain senses insincerity, ineptitude, or inconsistency, their brain's 'uh-oh' alarm will sound off subconsciously." He quotes the author and neuroscientist Antonio Damasio: "We are not thinking machines that feel, we are feeling machines that think."

Ralph Waldo Emerson celebrated Humboldt as &#x201c;one of those wonders of the world,&#x201d; and John Muir exclaimed, &#x201c;How intensely I desire to be a Humboldt!&#x201d; The great German poet Goethe was Humboldt&#x2019;s friend, and after reading Humboldt&#x2019;s work Charles Darwin, yearned to travel to distant lands.

For five years, from 1799 to 1804, Humboldt traveled through Central and South America. He and his collaborator, the French botanist Aim� Bonpland, journeyed on foot, by boat, and with mules through grasslands and forests, on rivers and across mountain ranges, and when Humboldt returned to Europe his coffers were full of scientific treasures. His legacy includes a sprawling body of knowledge, from the charge found in electric eels to the distribution of plants across different climate zones, and from the bioluminescence of jellyfish to the composition of falling stars.<br> </p><p>But the achievements for which Humboldt was most celebrated in his lifetime fell short of perfection. When he climbed the Chimborazo in Ecuador, then believed to be the highest mountain in the world, he did not quite reach the top; he established the existence of the Casiquiare, a natural canal between the vast water systems of the Orinoco and the Amazon, but this had been known to local people; and his magisterial work, Cosmos, was left unfinished.

Seeking the hidden connections of things, he put his finger on the spot where nature and human art correspond.

After five years of travelling, his coffers were full of the scientific treasures of the New World, and regular bulletins about his progress, published in the papers, had ensured that his exploits had not gone unappreciated by the public. The thirty-four-year-old, tanned, confident, and gifted with social ease, had, everybody knew, climbed the highest mountain in the world, the Chimborazo in the Andes. He had walked in untouched forests, spoken to the people who lived there, and discovered a secret natural canal, the Casiquiare, that linked the great water-systems of the Amazon and the Orinoco. He would have returned to Europe some months earlier had not Thomas Jefferson, the president of the United States, personally asked to make his acquaintance and to profit from his advice. <br><br> Alexander von Humboldt was the most celebrated scientist of the nineteenth century. Jefferson called Humboldt &#x2018;one of the greatest ornaments of the age.&#x2019; Charles Darwin, who took his copy of Humboldt&#x2019;s account of his travels in South America with him on his voyage on the <i>Beagle</i>, declared, &#x2018;my whole course of life is due to having read &amp; reread as a youth his <i>Personal Narrative</i>.&#x2019; Edgar Allen Poe dedicated a poem to Humboldt, Lord Byron mocked him in one of his, and the great German poet Goethe invoked him in a novel. <br><br> An astonishing number of places and things have been named after Humboldt, more, in fact, than after any other human being. Just a small selection includes an ocean current, three counties (in California, Iowa, and Nevada), several universities, an oak, a penguin, a squid, an asteroid, and a crater on the moon. <br><br> And yet, the fabric of Humboldt&#x2019;s life does not settle easily into a narrative defined by superlative achievements and public honours. Here, after all, is a man who recoiled in dread when told that a statue was to be erected in his honour. What is more, many of the claims made for him don&#x2019;t quite hold up when pressed into the framework of a heroic narrative. <br><br> The Chimborazo, of course, turned out not to be the highest mountain in the world at all. And while Humboldt had probably climbed to a greater height than anybody before him, he did not reach the summit, but had to turn back at around 5,600 metres. The existence of the Casiquiare canal had not only been known to local people, but also to the Acad�mie fran�aise, thanks to reports from the explorer Charles Marie de La Condamine, who had described it in 1745. The claim that is sometimes made for Humboldt&#x2015;that he anticipated the discovery of the theory of evolution&#x2015;distorts his vision, and sells short its distinctiveness. While Darwin did cite Humboldt&#x2019;s account of his travels as a personal inspiration, Humboldt&#x2019;s interest in unity in nature was in the tradition of Goethe&#x2019;s search for an underlying synthetic plan, a project fundamentally different from Darwin&#x2019;s theory of evolution by natural selection. (An eventual encounter between the two men in 1842 failed to reveal much common ground: Darwin reported later that he could not remember anything particular about their conversation, except that Humboldt had been &#x2018;very cheerful and talked much.&#x2019;) <br><br> If we change the focus and turn to presenting a man whose contradictions and ambiguous achievements are a function of his time, then a more nuanced, as well as a truer and more interesting picture emerges. Humboldt&#x2019;s life was deeply in tune with the most significant and ambitious themes of early German Romanticism. It was an exceptional life, lived in no less exceptional times. <br><br> German Romanticism was a heady movement. The Enlightenment had brought about a weakening of religious and societal restrictions on a scale that had not been seen before. At the same time, the Romantic focus on the individual placed a new value on feeling, legitimising the pursuit of personal needs and desires. With established ways of living often deeply unsatisfying, German Romantics discovered the thrill of living differently. There were new and often daring experimental set-ups, aimed at fashioning ways of life that better chimed with people&#x2019;s ideas of themselves than those prescribed for them by a still restrictive social order. In Berlin, salons sprang up, enthusiastically attended by the young Humboldt, where different segments of society mixed. People entertained the idea of trying out triangular arrangements, as did Humboldt&#x2019;s friend and mentor Georg Forster, who lived&#x2015;for a while&#x2015;with his wife, Therese, and her lover. Women rebelled against the idea that they had to persevere with unsuitable and often loveless marriages, and, if they found the economic means of escaping them, they often did. Caroline Michaelis and Dorothea Schlegel&#x2015;both women of letters and part of Humboldt&#x2019;s circle&#x2015;divorced their husbands, remarried, and discovered that societal disapproval was something they were able to live with. <br><br> Real life, of course, had a way of paling in comparison with an unachieved ideal. It was therefore in the nature of the project of finding new and better forms of living that the goal should never be quite reached, but should remain in the realm of the absolute. The unfulfilled was programmatic. The Blue Flower, the mysterious, ethereal symbol of German Romanticism, is so vaguely defined as to be forever elusive, and generally there is a preference for the absolute over the tangible. <br><br> Alexander von Humboldt was deeply committed to the Romantic project, both in his science as well as in the bold way that he chose to live his life. <br><br> The person who had introduced the motif of the Blue Flower was Friedrich von Hardenberg, who wrote under his better-known pen name, Novalis. Like Humboldt, he was a mining inspector, and, also like him, an alumnus of Germany&#x2019;s foremost mining academy. A number of Romanticism&#x2019;s leading figures worked in mining or wrote about it, and the connection left a mark on the thinking of the time. Going inside the earth became a metaphor for turning inside, towards the self and its dark depths, in the search for personal enlightenment and truth. <br><br> The turn to the interior also meant that the most objective criterion was, eventually, found in the most subjective one: what Humboldt&#x2019;s own senses told him. From his mining days onwards, Humboldt began to look at his own body as his most reliable and most decisive instrument. He conducted galvanic experiments on himself until the pain became so overwhelming that he had to stop; he tested the amount of dangerous mine gas his newly-developed miner&#x2019;s safety lamp could take before going out&#x2015;and almost extinguished himself in the process, having to be dragged out of a mine by his feet, unconscious. An ascent of the volcano Pichincha, near Quito, had to be abandoned when Humboldt came to the point of fainting. On the banks of the Orinoco, he contemplated the idea that the essence of a natural phenomenon could be grasped in its truest form through an emotional response. For this, it was necessary to go beyond the purely quantitative, the mere collecting of data, and gain what he called a &#x2018;total impression.&#x2019; This thought finds echoes in some of the ideas of the Romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling, Humboldt&#x2019;s acquaintance and sometime collaborator. If nature was an independent entity with agency of its own, and constructed on similar lines as the self, then its phenomena could be understood by intuition&#x2015;a process that would merge nature and self, the objective and the subjective. <br><br> Once a limit had been established, be it that of one&#x2019;s own body, experience, or tradition, the Romantic impulse was to go beyond it&#x2015;to widen the scope, and to open the view to the infinite. There was a predilection for the unfinished and incomplete, matched by an instinctive aversion to anything that was predictable and clearly delineated. <br><br> At the point of having secured a career that was destined to make him one of the most powerful men in the Prussian state administration, Alexander von Humboldt threw it away for an idea of almost spectacular vagueness&#x2015;something that amounted, at that stage, to little more than an ill-defined yearning to travel. <br><br> On the Chimborazo, a crevasse forced him to turn around, but, in better weather, a different route might have been tried. However, when conditions improved the next day, Humboldt declined to try again. He did not seem to see this as a failure, and after his journey he kept having himself painted against the Chimborazo as a background. He preferred to have his favourite mountain winking in the distance rather than have it underfoot. <br><br> When he came to evaluate and write up the results of his journey, many of the volumes he planned were never completed. This was not for lack of time&#x2015;he died in his ninetieth year. Most importantly, Humboldt failed to finish what was meant to be the synthesis of all his scientific achievements, his great work: <i>Cosmos (Kosmos)</i>. The missing section was to deal with human beings; he intended it to be the culmination of <i>Cosmos</i>, and it would have completed his project. Leaving a fragment was perhaps a more satisfying way to hint at a greater whole, just beyond grasp. <br><br> The great hope of Romantic science is not just to understand nature as an object. There is an idea that nature, elevated into a subject, should in turn affect a transformation in the observer. Goethe hinted at this most pithily when he wrote, with Humboldt in mind, that &#x2018;nobody walks under palm trees unpunished.&#x2019; <br><br> Humboldt achieved this ambition&#x2015;he was transformed by his experience of nature. In the Americas, he encountered a world that was defined almost in opposition to all he had known, and in it, more truly found his own self. He returned to Europe at peace with the person he was. His last decades found him in a domestic arrangement that was unusual, slightly mysterious, frowned on by his brother Wilhelm&#x2019;s family&#x2015;and, it seems, wholly agreeable to him. <br><br> Although Alexander von Humboldt kept many of the exact circumstances of this life to himself, the signs are that he succeeded in going beyond the boundaries of ordinary life, and discovered the possibility of a more benign, and a more generous dispensation. <br><br> Chapter 1: &#x2018;A Citizen of the World&#x2019; <br><br> The crossing from Havana to Philadelphia was perilous. On the evening of May 6, 1804, the sun, a pallid disk, grotesquely swollen, had sunk into the sea behind bottle green clouds&#x2015;&#x2018;a sight I will never forget,&#x2019; Humboldt recalled later, who thought it was a portend of disaster. He was right&#x2015;the next morning brought a heavy storm, one that would rage for six days. The rain came down so fast that it was more like a sort of dense, icy fog: &#x2018;drops fell like snow. It was impossible to turn the face to the wind.&#x2019; Everybody was wet to the skin, water sloshed down the cabin stairs, and portside, cooking pots, with the meals half-cooked, could be seen floating out of the galley. The sight of circling sharks did nothing to help the general mood. The sailors seemed to have little confidence about their prospects&#x2015;they kept asking for more brandy, following the logic that if one was to be drowned, one might as well drown one&#x2019;s sorrows first. <br><br> Three days into this, on the morning of May 9, things got so bad that Humboldt believed that all was lost. He felt strangely exhilarated. His life, he reflected, had been full and happy. After a journey that had exceeded all that he had been hoping and wishing for, perhaps it was only fair that he should now pay the price. <br><br> But he also reproached himself. He had explored the interior of South America, faced countless dangers, and yet emerged unscathed. Was he now, so close to the finishing line, to go down together with all the treasures he had gathered, his notes and his plant specimens, many of them of species new to science? What was more, his decision to travel to the United States, he knew and admitted freely, had been &#x2018;in no way necessary.&#x2019; <br><br> After his time in South America, from July 1799 to early 1803, Humboldt had spent a year in Mexico, and then sailed on to Cuba, to pick up some of his collections that he had stored there earlier. While he was preparing them for shipping to Europe, the American consul in Havana, Vincent F. Gray, approached him and invited him to visit the United States, and to meet President Jefferson. <br><br> There was no shortage of reasons why it would have been expedient to decline and return to Europe without further delay, and compelling ones, too: while Humboldt couldn&#x2019;t have predicted how close to disaster the passage from Havana to the United States would come, he did know that, with the approaching hurricane season, it would not be without risk. And after all these years of travelling, and having pushed at the borders of physical endurance, he was weary, and wanted to be home. Also, there was a concern that, with his active research completed, his findings might lose their immediacy, or be overtaken. Now was the time to present the fruits of his journey to the scientific world back home. &#x2018;I think of nothing but of preserving and publishing my manuscripts,&#x2019; Humboldt had written. &#x2018;How I long to be in Paris!&#x2019; <br><br> And yet, when the chance presented itself to visit the United States, Humboldt grasped at it without hesitation. <br><br> An idea of his motivation can be glimpsed in the letter he wrote to Jefferson: &#x2018;In spite of my intense desire to be back in Paris [. . .], I could not resist the moral interest to see the United States and to enjoy the comforting aspect of a people who appreciate the precious gift of freedom.&#x2019; <br><br> The notion of freedom had always held a place of special, almost sacred importance in the firmament of Humboldt&#x2019;s ideals. He took great pride in the fact that, on passing through Paris on the first anniversary of the French Revolution, he had helped cart some sand to the Temple of Liberty with his own hands. Conversely, having witnessed on his travels the suffering of indigenous people subjugated by colonists and the church, he had been confirmed in his belief that lack of freedom and autonomy was one of the most insidious causes of human misery. <br><br> The United States, on the other hand, was the first nation in the Americas that had successfully liberated itself from the yoke of colonial rule. While France, where Napoleon was preparing to have himself crowned as emperor, had strayed far from the ideals of the Revolution, it seemed to have fallen to the United States to show that there could be another model. After all, the man he had been invited to meet, Thomas Jefferson, had drafted the Declaration of Independence, with its ringing emphasis on equality and freedom. Both these lofty notions, of course, might have suffered some qualification due to the fact that Jefferson himself was a slaveholder. However, Humboldt seems to have opted for leaving such thorny questions aside for the moment. <br><br> * <br><br> The storm did not sink the ship, and on May 19, Humboldt had the chance to form his first impression of the United States from the sea. Compared to the lush tropical coastlines he had become used to, the vegetation seemed sparse&#x2015;like strokes of pen on paper. It was ...</p><h2>Theological Highlights of Vatican II</h2><p>Here is a significant book comprising Joseph Ratzinger's report on the debates and struggles that made up each of the four sessions of Vatican II (1962-65), along with theological commentary by a noted scholar and professor.<br><br>At the council Ratzinger worked on the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation (Dei verbum), the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church (Lumen gentium), and the Decree on the Missionary Activity of the Church (Ad gentes).

He hated the vines that crept up the redbrick and the way the peaks over the upstairs windows looked like angry eyebrows. He hated the creaky floors and the weird wallpaper... but most of all, he hated his new attic bedroom&#x2014;especially when he discovered a ghostly creature was living there.<br> Daniel&#x2019;s first clue about the creature was the mysterious puddle at the top of the stairs.<br> &#x201c;Oof!&#x201d; he said, landing on his bum. It was moving day, and he&#x2019;d been carrying a box of Lego. Pieces crashed to the floor and skittered under the furniture like beetles afraid of the light.<br> Daniel stood up and examined his wet shorts. &#x201c;Mom!&#x201d; he called. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a puddle on my floor!&#x201d;<br> Daniel found his mom in the bathroom.

At first it seemed to work. The room stayed silent for a long time. So long that Daniel almost convinced himself he&#x2019;d imagined the whole thing.<br> &#x201c;Buttermelons? Peeze! None? Nooooooooo.&#x201d;<br> The voice came again, even more quivery than before.

For Catholics, history has an even higher purpose beside. For them, history is the unfolding of God's Will in time, and the attempts of men either to conform themselves to or to resist that Will.</p><p>But American Catholic historians have generally refrained from exploring their own national history with these principles, preferring instead to adopt the analysis of their non-Catholic colleagues, save when looking at purely Catholic topics (and sometimes not then). It is vital then, for Catholics, especially young Catholics, to have a good and proper understanding of their country's history. To exercise their patriotism, they must work for the conversion of the United States; to do this effectively, they must understand the forces and events which brought forth not only the religion of Americanism and the country itself, but also the sort of Catholicism which, in 300 years, failed so dismally to bring this conversion about.</p><p> This book attempts to reinterpret the better known episodes of our history in accordance with the Faith, and to point up lesser-known details which will give factual proof of the truth of this reinterpretation.</p></p><p>"One of the most exceptional and relevant books produced in this century." - <b>Laramie Hirsch</b>, <i>The Hirsch Files</i><br><br>"The book can help us make America Catholic again." - <b>Gary Potter</b>, <i>Catholicism.org</i> <br><br>"Coulombe's <i>Puritan's Empire</i> may be as valuable a consideration of American history, as that history as yet produced." - <b>Richard Cowden Guido</b>, author of <i>John Paul II &amp; the Battle for Vatican II</i><br><br>"<i>Puritan's Empire</i> will help you to better see yourself, and your duty, as a Catholic American." - <b>Sherry Foster</b>, <i>The Remnant Newspaper</i></p><h2>The Book of Seals &amp; Amulets</h2><p>The "Shadow Tree Series" comprises a unique collection of Western Esoteric studies and practices which Jacobus G.

Its texts have been copied and recopied. And despite the most careful and painstaking efforts of scribes and publishers down through the centuries, errors of one sort or another have crept in and have been reproduced. Sorting out the errors and determining the original wording is the task of textual criticism. In fact, the task of textual criticism is so daunting and detailed that it is divided between Old Testament textual critics and New Testament textual critics. That is why nearly every book on the subject focuses on the textual criticism of either the Old or New Testament. But if you are one of those interested in a general understanding of textual criticism, this book introduces you to textual criticism of the whole Bible--the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament. In plain language and with ample illustration, Paul D. Wegner gives you an overview of the history and methods, aims and results of textual criticism. In the process you will gain an appreciation for the vast work that has been accomplished in preserving the text of Scripture and find a renewed confidence in its reliability.</p><p><strong>Paul D. Wegner</strong> is professor of Old Testament at Phoenix Seminary in Phoenix, Arizona. He is the author of <em>The Journey from Texts to Translations: The Origin and Development of the Bible.</em>Wegner has provided teachers and students with a clearly written and wonderfully illustrated introduction to the practice of textual criticism of the entire Bible. (JETS, November 2007)<br><br>This inexpensive book can be read with profit by student and specialist alike. Its particular strengths are that it treats both OT and NT and that the text is accompanied by more than one hundred illustrations of various kinds that help to bring the history of the discipline alive for the reader. I read through the book with the same excitement that I have when reading a good detective novel! (Claude E. Cox, The Catholic Biblical Quarterly 69, 2007)<br><br>An exceptional resource presenting the topic will well-grounded research, unambiguous style, an exceptional glossary and a thorough index. [Wegner] covers the vastly different fields of OT and NT textual criticism and does an admirable job presenting difficult issues in an understandable fashion. . . . Overall, the work is a welcome addition and will prove to be a valuable asset for unfolding the mysteries of textual criticism. (Darin M. Wood, Southwestern Journal of Theology, Vol. 47 (2))<br><br>"No introductory textbook to textual criticism of the Bible measures up to <em>A Student's Guide to Textual Criticism of the Bible.</em> It uniquely combines Old Testament and New Testament textual criticism into one handy, delightfully illustrated volume. Paul Wegner writes for students, successfully guiding them through the text's long and complex journey by his clear style, objectivity and arresting photographs. General readers of the Bible will appreciate this introduction to the textual notes in their Bibles." (Bruce K. Waltke, Professor of Old Testament, Reformed Theological Seminary, and Emeritus Professor of Old Testament, Regent College)<br><br>"Here, at last, is a well-written, succinctly stated, wisely selected history and wonderfully illustrated textual criticism guide that covers both testaments in one volume. Where others have often made this science sound arcane and obtuse, Paul Wegner has skillfully described textual criticism in plain but ample and interesting ways. I highly recommend it to all serious Bible students, but especially to seminary faculty who must juggle book budgets and who up to now have had to order a separate text in this area for each testament." (Walter C. Kaiser Jr., President and Colman M. Mockler Distinguished Professor of Old Testament, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)<br><br>"If you are looking for an introduction to the complex world of textual criticism from a trusted and reliable source then <em>A Student?s Guide to Textual Criticism</em> is a book you should not overlook. Wegner has skillfully gathered a wealth of imperative information and presented it with judicious care and attention for the student of Scripture. If you are a pastor, teacher, student, or interested laymen, I couldn?t recommend this resource enough. It will encourage and enhance your understand and confidence in the Bible."

The British are losing a bitter war against the Boers while the German kaiser is busy building a vast new navy. The United States is struggling to put down an insurgency in the South Pacific while the upstart imperialist Japan begins to make clear to neighboring Russia its territorial ambition. In China, a perennial pawn in the Great Game, a mysterious group of superstitious peasants is launching attacks on the Western powers they fear are corrupting their country. These ordinary Chinese&#x2015;called Boxers by the West because of their martial arts showmanship&#x2015;rise up seemingly out of nowhere. Foreshadowing the insurgencies of our recent past, they lack a centralized leadership and instead tap into latent nationalism and deep economic frustration to build their army.<br> Many scholars brush off the Boxer Rebellion as an ill-conceived and easily defeated revolt, but in <i>The Boxer Rebellion and the Great Game in China</i>, the military historian David J. Silbey shows just how close the Boxers came to beating back the combined might of the imperial powers. Drawing on the diaries and letters of allied soldiers and diplomats, he paints a vivid portrait of the war.

The Downeaster train had brought her up from Boston, which had been her first stop after flying in from Chicago, as she&#x2019;d had to do a final fitting before picking up her bridesmaid dress at the Boston bridal shop on her way to Maine for her best friend&#x2019;s wedding. Now she just had to find Emma Tolliver, the bride, in the station and they would set out for Bluff Point, which was a half-hour drive up the coastline.</p><p>The two-and-a-half-hour train ride had given Mac plenty of time to think about the next two weeks. Emma, being Emma, had planned a wedding that was not just the celebration of two people uniting their lives. Oh, no, it was more like a two-week hostage situation where there were daily itineraries of endless activities designed to milk every magical matrimonial moment out of the event. Just reading the five-page itinerary with detailed instructions that Emma had e-mailed the wedding party exhausted Mac.</p><p>Despite the intensity of the agenda, Mac planned to participate fully. She understood that the over-the-top celebrating was a part of who Emma had become when her mother passed away so young. Emma was always the one who made every birthday, Christmas, or Valentine&#x2019;s Day one to be remembered, since she had a deep-seated fear that each one might be the last.</p><p>Since it was an Emma extravaganza, there were a million picky little details to nail down, and Mac had made a personal vow that she would be the perfect maid of honor for Emma. She would do whatever Emma asked of her and serve it up with a smile on the side. She hoped this would alleviate the guilt she felt since she had been such a no-show as a maid of honor thus far.</p><p>Mac wheeled her suitcase beside her as she entered the station, narrowly missing a mom and her two sons who were on their way out. One of the boys gave her stink eye and Mac gave it right back. The boy&#x2019;s eyes went wide with fright&#x2014;Mac gave really good stink eye&#x2014;and then she winked at him, letting him know all was forgiven. He grinned before he scampered off to catch up to his mom.</p><p>Mac entered the station and scanned the large room, looking for Emma. Her friend&#x2019;s long, straight blond hair usually gave away her location at a glance, but Mac did a quick visual sweep and didn&#x2019;t see her. She searched again, thinking Emma might have her hair in a topknot or a ponytail, but no. There was no petite blonde anywhere to be seen.</p><p>Mac shrugged and hauled her bags over to a seat. Maybe Emma was running late. She dug in her purse for her cell phone to see if there was a text she had missed, but as she moved her hand around the voluminous bag, she couldn&#x2019;t find her phone. She sighed.</p><p>She loved her big bag, she really did. It was one of the many reasons she&#x2019;d let her gym membership lapse, besides the fact that she never actually went, as she figured carrying around twenty pounds of stuff kept her fit enough, but at times like this, which were frequent, she thought she really needed to downsize.</p><p>A buzz sounded from her bag and Mac held it open wide, hoping the display screen would light up so she could see it. Ha! There was a blue glow coming from the bottom. She snatched up her phone and answered it without pausing to look at the number.</p><p>&#x201c;Emma, I&#x2019;m here, where are you?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m right behind you,&#x201d; a man answered.</p><p>Seven years. It had been seven years since Mac had heard his voice, which was much deeper than she remembered, but still she would know Gavin Tolliver&#x2019;s voice in a crowded room loud with conversation and laughter. His was the sort of voice that wrapped around you like a hug. It was deep and masculine but full of warmth and kindness with a self-deprecating humor to it that Mac had always found charming even when Gav was a gawky teen just learning how to talk to girls.</p><p>Mac closed her eyes and braced herself before slowly turning around, still holding the phone to her ear. Her heart was pumping hard in her chest and when she looked at the man walking toward her it stopped for a solid three beats before it resumed its rhythm with a thump to the chest that felt like a closed fist to the sternum. Oomph!</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Mac,&#x201d; Gavin said into his phone, bringing his voice intimately into her ear while she stared into his baby blues. A woman could drown in eyes that pretty. How had she forgotten? Mac yanked the phone from her ear and ended the call.</p><p>&#x201c;Gav,&#x201d; she said on a shaky exhale. He stopped in front of her right on the periphery of her personal space. She forced herself to smile with teeth, which felt like more of a snarl. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t expecting you. How are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Better now that you&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Mac gave him a wary look. What the hell did that mean?</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure if I misplaced my sister&#x2019;s maid of honor, I&#x2019;d have to flee the state or possibly the country,&#x201d; he teased. He smiled at her and Mac felt it all the way down to her toes.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yeah, huh,&#x201d; Mac stammered. She resisted the urge to do a face palm. She sounded like a moron.</p><p>&#x201c;Come here,&#x201d; Gavin said. He tucked his phone into his jeans pocket and held out his arms. &#x201c;A proper greeting is required for the return of the prodigal Mac.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, right, of course,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>In her state of shock at seeing him, Mac&#x2019;s legs were refusing to follow the basic one-foot-in-front-of-the-other protocol and she lurched forward into his arms, forcing him to catch her before she took them both down.</p><p>It was a good bracing squeeze, the sort cousins shared at annual family reunions. But it was enough for Mac to catalog the fact that this was not the man-boy she had fumbled around in a pickup truck with all those years ago. Oh, no, this was a man who stood well over six feet tall, with broad shoulders, a lean waist, and powerful arms. Gavin Tolliver had grown into a hottie when she wasn&#x2019;t looking.</p><p>Amazingly, his scent was the same and it struck Mac in the olfactory system like a lightning strike. The warm citrusy cedar smell that was uniquely Gavin blew open the locked door of her memories, and Mac was hit like a two-fingered poke to the eyeballs with a mental picture of the man in her arms, sans clothes, holding her close and going in for a bone-wilter of a kiss. Ack!</p><p>She jumped out of his arms so fast she tripped over her suitcase and landed in a heap on the bench seat behind her. She cracked her hip on the wooden edge and the pain rocketed up her back but she refused to let it show. Instead, she quickly crossed her legs and threw her arm over the seat back, pretending that she meant to do that.</p><p>Gavin looked surprised and then he grinned at her as if he found her adorable and not freaky, which she clearly was. Mac wondered how she could have forgotten the dimple that dented his right cheek when he smiled or the girlishly long, thick lashes that framed his eyes so becomingly. Then he winked at her and she felt as if everything she had ever known to be true had just hopped on the Downeaster train back to Boston.</p><p>This was not the Gavin Tolliver she remembered in his grubby little league uniform who thought it was hilarious to stick whoopee cushions under her sleeping bag when she spent the night at Emma&#x2019;s, for that was the only image of him she had ever allowed herself to recall after their one night together. It had worked like a charm to banish the memory of what had been the most amazing sexual encounter of her life. She had even convinced herself that their night together had only been spectacular because she had just been left at the altar and had been as emotionally charged as a hair dryer tossed into a bathtub.</p><p>But now, this man standing in front of her in his well-worn jeans and work boots was making the past seven years of her carefully crafted revisionist history an utter mockery. This guy had charisma and sexual magnetism to the tenth power. When he smiled at her she actually felt her skin get hot and when he winked, well, her girl parts almost overheated. Dang, this guy could probably unhook her bra just by looking at it!</p><p>There was no doubt about it, Mac was screwed. Or maybe, she just wanted to be. Gah! Mac shook her head, trying to dislodge that thought. No, no, no! This was Emma&#x2019;s little brother! She tried to picture him in his little league uniform. Sadly, she could not shove the man body in the form-fitting gray T-shirt in front of her into a dirty eight-year-old&#x2019;s baseball uniform. Damn it!</p><p>&#x201c;Mac, are you okay?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;You look mad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; She glared at him. Then she glanced away, trying to avoid his gaze. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. Just tired.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Long day of travel,&#x201d; he said. His voice was kind and understanding, which Mac found unreasonably annoying. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m parked right outside. Come on, let&#x2019;s get you home.&#x201d;</p><p>Without waiting for her answer, he took her hand and pulled her to her feet. Then he grabbed her bags as if they weighed nothing and wheeled them toward the door. Mac had no choice but to grab her purse and her garment bag and follow. She wished she had worn a better travel outfit than jeans and a T-shirt, then berated herself for even thinking about her outfit, and then she cursed Emma for not warning her that it was Gavin who would pick her up. Suddenly, the next two weeks looked more like an incarceration than a celebration, and Mac did not have a get-out-of-jail-free card.</p><p>Gavin hefted Mac&#x2019;s bags into the back of a big black pickup truck. So he still drove a truck&#x2014;a different truck, but still a truck. She went to open the passenger door but he got there first, holding it open for her to climb in. Mac squeezed by him, trying not to brush up against him as she went. Healthy boundaries were going to be scrupulously maintained if a mere smell memory had her picturing him naked. Oh, horror!</p><p>He shut the door and jogged around the front of the truck. She turned on her phone and toyed with the screen, pretending to be doing something other than avoiding looking at him, which was really what she was doing.</p><p>Gav pulled out of the parking lot and turned onto the road that would take them home. Mac glanced out her window, wondering if the silence felt as awkward to him as it did to her. She supposed she should say something, but she had no idea what.</p><p>Why couldn&#x2019;t she be like her friend Carly, who in her usual blunt fashion would just give his ass a squeeze, crack a bawdy joke about the last time they saw each other, and move on? Or her other friend, Jillian, who would say something kind but distant, which would effectively put up a barrier as daunting as razor wire between them, letting him know they were not going there. Ever.</p><p>Sadly, it was neither of those two who had slept with their best friend&#x2019;s little brother. Oh, no, that was Mac, who as a corporate accountant who operated in numbers and facts and bottom lines had zero capacity to navigate life&#x2019;s layers of innuendo. Damn it!</p><p>&#x201c;So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Gavin said. He gave her a sideways glance when she turned to look at him. &#x201c;Are you hungry?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Not at all. Not even a little. I&#x2019;m good. Thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>She pressed her lips together to shut herself up and turned away from him. Ugh, she couldn&#x2019;t even look at him. She could be half starved to death and desperate for a ham sandwich and she wouldn&#x2019;t do anything that would prolong their time together for even a nanosecond. Seriously, if she had to go to the bathroom, she would risk peeing her pants before she&#x2019;d extend this trip to include a pit stop. Thankfully, she did not have to go.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Gavin said. Again, his voice was gentle, as if he were talking to an injured baby bird. &#x201c;Let me know if you need anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Will do,&#x201d; Mac said. &#x201c;Roger that, you betcha, by golly wow.&#x201d;</p><p>Okay, now the urge to punch herself in the temple and knock herself out was almost more than she could stand. Being unprepared to see him again had reduced her to a babbling idiot.</p><p>He, on the other hand, did not seem to be suffering from any awkwardness. Obviously, Gavin either didn&#x2019;t remember what had happened between them seven years ago or he was so completely over it that it didn&#x2019;t occur to him that being thrown together after seven years of radio silence was weird. Now didn&#x2019;t that just fluff up her ego?</p><p>Still, if he had forgotten all about that night, it was most definitely for the best and it made her relax just the teensiest bit. Perhaps all of her worry had been for nothing and everything was going to be just fine over the next two weeks.</p><p>She stole a look at him, then glanced back out the window and then back at him. His hair was cut short on the sides and longer on top. It was several shades darker than his sister&#x2019;s, almost brown but not quite, but not really blond either. His bangs fell over his forehead in a casual way that could have been created with a lot of product and artful arrangement but Mac suspected was more the result of a quick towel dry and a distracted manner.</p><p>Despite the fact that Mac hadn&#x2019;t seen him in years, she knew the highlight reel. Emma had kept her apprised of all the main events in Gavin&#x2019;s life. He had gone to veterinary school, graduated at the top of his class, and had returned home to work at old Doc Scharff&#x2019;s practice. Doc was in semi-retirement and was training Gavin to take over the biz fully when he was done. Emma was so proud of her brother; she practically glowed when she talked about him.</p><p>Although she never admitted it, Mac knew that Emma had put her life on hold until she knew Gavin was settled. She always said she and Brad were saving for a house before they got married, but Mac suspected that Emma had been waiting to make sure Gavin could stand on his own two feet before she started a family of her own. Mac had a feeling Gavin didn&#x2019;t realize it and would be pretty unhappy if he ever figured it out.</p><p>Maybe that&#x2019;s just how big sisters were with little brothers. Mac didn&#x2019;t know because she didn&#x2019;t have any siblings. The only person who had ever been like a younger sibling to her was Gavin, and, oh yeah, she had slept with him. Even thinking about it made Mac feel dirty.</p><p>Emma hadn&#x2019;t only shared Gavin&#x2019;s accomplishments, she had also kept Mac informed on his love life even though Mac had never asked and really didn&#x2019;t want to know. The last girlfriend, Jane, had never been a favorite of Emma&#x2019;s. She had dubbed her Jane-the-Pain, which had been shortened to &#x201c;the pain&#x201d; for the duration of their relationship and had then morphed into &#x201c;the beyotch&#x201d; after Jane ran off with Gavin&#x2019;s business manager.</p><p>Mac didn&#x2019;t like knowing all of the sordid details about Gavin&#x2019;s personal life, but she had never been able to stop Emma from oversharing without giving her a solid reason why. Now she was uncomfortable knowing as much as she did and not knowing what to say to him about any of it. The silence in the cramped cab of the truck was becoming excruciating, however, and she didn&#x2019;t think she could take it anymore as they crossed over the Presumpscot River, heading north on Route 1.</p><p>&#x201c;So, it looks like they&#x2019;ll have a nice day for the wedding,&#x201d; she said. She grabbed for the old New England mainstay of talking about the weather like...</p></p><h2>Water in Plain Sight: Hope for a Thirsty World</h2><p><p>Water scarcity is on everyone&#x2019;s mind. Long taken for granted, water availability has become dependent on economics, politics, and people&#x2019;s food and lifestyle choices. But as anxiety mounts&#x2015;and even as a swath of California farmland has been left fallow, and extremist groups worldwide exploit the desperation of people losing livelihoods to desertification&#x2015;many are finding new routes to water security with key implications for food access, economic resilience, and climate change.</p> <p>Water does not perish, nor does it require millions of years to form as do fossil fuels. However water is always on the move and we must learn to work with its natural movement. In this timely, important book, Judith D. Schwartz presents a refreshing perspective on water that transcends zero-sum thinking. By allying with the water cycle, we can revive lush, productive landscapes, like the river in rural Zimbabwe that now flows miles further than it has in living memory thanks to restorative grazing; the fruit-filled food forest in Tucson, Arizona, grown by harvesting urban wastewater; or the mini-oasis in West Texas nourished by dew.</p> <p>Animated by stories from around the globe, <em>Water In Plain Sight</em> is an inspiring reminder that fixing the future of our drying planet involves understanding what makes natural systems thrive.</p></p><p><p>Judith D. Schwartz is a journalist whose recent work looks at soil as a hub for multiple environmental, economic, and social challenges and solutions. She writes on this theme for numerous publications and speaks at venues around the world. Her 2013 book <em>Cows Save the Planet</em> was awarded a Nautilus Book Award Silver Prize for Sustainability and was among <em>Booklist</em>&#x2019;s Top 10 Books on Sustainability in 2014. A graduate of the Columbia Journalism School and Brown University, she lives in Vermont.</p><p>&#x201c;Judith Schwartz&#x2019;s work gives us not just hope but also a sense that we humans&#x2015;serial destroyers that we are&#x2015;can actually turn the climate crisis around.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Gretel Ehrlich, author of&nbsp;<em>Facing the Wave</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This book is part of a necessary movement to restore water to a central place in the climate and ecological conversation. Judith Schwartz paints a vivid picture of the miracles of land healing that are possible through the right relationship to soil and water. This book should be high on the reading list of every environmental activist.&#x201d;<strong><em>&#x2015;</em>Charles Eisenstein, author of&nbsp;<em>Climate&#x2015;A New Story</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;People all over the world agonize about water&#x2015;too much or not enough&#x2015;and are directed to expensive, high-tech solutions. But in this important and exhilarating book, Judith Schwartz argues that the solutions lie in understanding and working with nature. Herein lies abundance and hope.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Kristin Ohlson, author of&nbsp;<em>The Soil Will Save Us</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Our freshwater crisis isn&#x2019;t just caused by drought and overconsumption&#x2015;it&#x2019;s also the product of deforestation, unmanaged grazing, the destruction of wildlife, and other benighted land management practices. Fortunately, there are solutions. <em>Water in Plain Sight</em> reveals that restoring our planet&#x2019;s ecosystems can help replenish our most precious resource. In her inspiring, erudite book, Judith Schwartz introduces readers to the Amish farming consultants, Texas dew harvesters, and Zimbabwean graziers who are developing world-changing approaches to ecological restoration and water stewardship. <em>Water in Plain Sight </em>proves that our water woes aren&#x2019;t inevitable, and that the most sustainable path forward lies in partnering with nature rather than attempting to wrestle it into submission.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Ben Goldfarb, author of <em>Eager</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In this beautifully written book about water, Judith Schwartz reveals that water is far more than the elixir of life. For the non-specialist but informed reader, Schwartz imaginatively unpacks the vital role that water plays in not just our natural and farming landscape functions, but also in our planet&#x2019;s self-organizing and sustaining systems.</p> <p>Richly researched and written in a deceptively easy and personal style, <em>Water in Plain Sight</em> renders the complex comprehensible, enjoyable, and thus accessible. As a consequence, in the midst of humanity&#x2019;s obtuse behaviour in destabilizing our Earth and landscape systems, Schwartz&#x2015;through her thematic focus on water&#x2015;delightfully explains the key principles that can enable us to begin addressing our Anthropocene challenge while offering hope for regeneration of both planetary and human health.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Charles Massy, author of&nbsp;<em>Call of the Reed Warbler</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;The water cycle is Earth&#x2019;s greatest gift to life, yet it is now badly broken. Through fascinating stories, Judith Schwartz reveals how we can work with nature to make the cycle function again&#x2015;and in doing so lessen climate change, build healthier landscapes, and boost our odds for sustained prosperity. There is no message more important today, and it is time to act on it.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Sandra Postel, author of <em>Replenish</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Imagine having a wise and well-traveled friend eager to take you on a global tour of water triumphs and failures.

They don&#x2019;t happen that often, for one thing.</p><p><i>But wait, O wise angel</i>, I hear you say. <i>How can there be trials in Heaven?</i></p><p>Which is a perfectly good question, because once you&#x2019;ve made it to the Big Happy you should be golden, right? You&#x2019;ve been judged righteous or you wouldn&#x2019;t get in, and after that you&#x2019;re doing the work of the Highest, so how could you go wrong?</p><p>Well, first of all, there&#x2019;s the whole Free Will thing&#x2014;people and angels have to be free to make mistakes, or else we live in a clockwork universe where everything&#x2019;s predetermined and perfect. Most of the time Heaven does seem like that, a flock of serene shiny creatures living in complete harmony, a hive of buzzing happiness and shared purpose. But we all know that in nature, no matter how well any system works, there&#x2019;s always a couple of dumbass birds heading north for the winter when everyone else is flying south, or one dipshit salmon belly-surfing down the rapids, yelling, &#x201c;Whoo, yeah! Check me out!&#x201d; as he smacks face first into the more sensible fish swimming upstream to spawn. The fact that these unrepresentative idiots freeze and plummet from the sky or die without issue isn&#x2019;t the point&#x2014;the point is Free Will, and apparently we angels are capable of poor impulse control just like everybody else. Thus, there <i>are</i> trials in Heaven, and I was about to attend my first.</p><p>Although &#x201c;attend&#x201d; is a bit misleading, I admit. It wasn&#x2019;t really my first, because I&#x2019;d been aware of several other trials. Here in the Happy Place you can know about important things like that and even follow them closely without actually being present, although it&#x2019;s hard to explain, because&#x2014;duh&#x2014;it&#x2019;s another Heaven thing. Imagine sitting in a crowded bar when the playoffs are on and a local team is involved: you don&#x2019;t have to stay glued to the screen to know what&#x2019;s going on in the game; you can pick up what&#x2019;s happening in a dozen different ways. And that&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;d done my trial-watching in the past.</p><p>But this trial was going to be different, and so I had secured myself an excellent seat, front row center. The poor bastard angel on trial was going to face the full weight of Heaven&#x2019;s judgement, and the entire Shining City was full of anticipation. The Hall of Justice sparkled and throbbed with the light of watching angels, angels who wanted more than just a general feeling about this trial, who wanted to experience it up close and personal. I thought I even saw my boss, Archangel Temuel (who us angelic grunts usually called &#x201c;The Mule&#x201d;) not too far away.</p><p>The crowd of the Saved, jostling each other in the massive shining hall despite being only semi-tangible (another Heaven thing which doesn&#x2019;t really translate), began to murmur with anticipation as the jury appeared, a row of blooming angelic flames that represented the great and the good&#x2014;in fact some of the very greatest and goodest that our Third Sphere had to offer. I recognized them all.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>We Are Convened In The Sight Of The Highest To Do Justice.</i>&#x201d; These words came from the diamond-faceted white light that represented Terentia, a powerful angel who was acting as master of ceremonies. The other four heavenly judges, Karael, Raziel, Anaita, and Chamuel watched silently from beside her, their flames lined up like a menorah on Hanukkah Day Five. &#x201c;<i>God Loves You All</i>,&#x201d; Terentia added, then turned her attention to me. <i>&#x201c;Angel Advocate Doloriel,</i> <i>You Are Accused Of Conspiring Against Heaven&#x2019;s Laws. In Addition To Several Crimes, You Are Also Charged With The Sins Of Wrath, Pride, Envy, And Avarice, All Most Dreadful. If You Are Found Guilty, You Will Be Cast From Heaven And Into The Unholy Pit, There To Dwell In Suffering For Eternity. Do You Have Any Questions Before We Begin?&#x201d;</i></p><p>So, yeah, the reason I had such a good seat was because I was the one on trial. And if you&#x2019;ve got questions, believe me, so did I&#x2014;probably the same ones, in fact, beginning with &#x201c;How did I get here?&#x201d; and &#x201c;How do I get out of here again?&#x201d; But for reasons I&#x2019;ll explain as I go, I didn&#x2019;t think it would do me any good to ask.</p><p>&#x201c;Look, you&#x2019;ve already decided what you&#x2019;re going to do,&#x201d; I said, with what I hoped came off as a tough, cold-blooded calm I sure didn&#x2019;t feel. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s cut to the chase, because we all know the fun part is going to be the sentencing.&#x201d;</p><p><i>But wait,</i> I hear you say. <i>How did you wind up on trial in Heaven, Bobby Dollar? How could such a thing happen to you, one of Heaven&#x2019;s most beloved and respected angels?</i></p><p>Oh, yeah, that&#x2019;s hilarious. Kick a guy when he&#x2019;s on trial for his immortal soul just to get a cheap laugh, why don&#x2019;t you?</p><p>You really want to hear how I wound up here? I guess it started with a dream I had.<br></p><p><b>one<br>just an angel</b></p><p>The wood was stacked higher than the heads of the catcalling spectators. On top of the mountainous pyre, the prisoner sagged against the stake like something unreal, a discarded shop-window dummy or a forgotten toy. The condemned wore a soldier&#x2019;s gleaming armor, but the slightness of the figure told a different story. This was a woman about to be burned. This was St. Joan.</p><p>She lifted her head and looked out across the crowded town square. Our eyes met. I saw the pale white-gold hair, the eyes red as blood, and my heart went cold. This wasn&#x2019;t the Maid of Orleans, it was Caz&#x2014;<i>my</i> Caz, my beautiful demon-woman, the creature who had both captured and endangered my soul.</p><p>Someone set fire to the stacked wood. The kindling caught first, freeing wisps of white smoke that quickly rose and spread around her feet. Within moments the flames began to climb the sides of the pyre, painting the rising smoke with sunset tones. Caz struggled against her bonds, more and more desperate as the fire rose.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t move. I opened my mouth and tried to call to her, but I couldn&#x2019;t speak, either. I was frozen, helpless. When she needed me most, I couldn&#x2019;t do a thing.</p><p><i>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t reach you!&#x201d;</i> she cried, coils of smoke climbing her writhing body like snakes. <i>&#x201c;Oh, Bobby! I can&#x2019;t reach you!&#x201d;</i> Then her words turned to shrieks.</p><p>Flames leaped high into the air, until I could hardly make her out through the shimmer of heat. Her struggling figure, the smoke, the buildings in the background, all bent and wavered as if under water. Then, through the rising, spreading cloud, I saw a clutter in the air above her&#x2014;winged shapes, dropping from the sky.</p><p><i>Hallelujah!</i> The bells of the town began to clang, ringing out the song of redemption. <i>Hallelujah!</i> The winged ones swept down through the smoke&#x2014;angels, angels coming to save her!</p><p>But then I saw the shapes more clearly. Maybe it was the warping of the heated air, but these supposed rescuers looked grim and terrible, eyes lightning-bright, wings black as burnt paper and glowing at the edges as though fire were their natural element.</p><p><i>Angels,</i> I wondered, <i>or demons?</i> Coming to save her&#x2014;or drag her back to endless torment? Paralyzed, silent, I could only watch as the bells grew louder, louder.</p><p><i>Hallelujah!</i></p><p><i>HAH-lay-loo-yah!</i></p><p><i>HAH-lay-loo-yah!</i></p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>I lurched upright, my blanket tangled around me. The room was dark except for a little bit of streetlight creeping in between the cheap curtains. No flames, no smoke, but my phone kept beeping out that horrible joke melody over and over.</p><p><i>HAH-lay-loo-yah!</i></p><p>My phone. It was just my phone.</p><p><i>Yeah,</i> I thought through the pounding of my heart and the slow gathering of my confused thoughts<i>. Fuck you, Handel&#x2014;and your fucking Chorus, too. And fuck whoever in Heaven decided to use it as our ringtone.</i></p><p>After knocking half the crap off my nightstand, I found the phone and then the &#x201c;talk&#x201d; button. The hosanna-ing finally stopped.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; My pulse was banging like I had stumbled off a cliff into empty air. &#x201c;This better be good or someone&#x2019;s gonna die.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Someone already did.&#x201d; It was Alice from the downtown office&#x2014;our local branch of Heaven&#x2019;s management. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a client, Dollar.&#x201d; She gave me the details like she was reading a shopping list. &#x201c;Go get &#x2019;em, cowboy. And maybe you wouldn&#x2019;t be such a grumpy piece of shit if you didn&#x2019;t drink yourself to sleep.&#x201d;</p><p>She hung up before any witty replies occurred to me.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t reach you!&#x201d; Caz had cried in my dream. And I couldn&#x2019;t reach her, either, because we were separated by much more than distance. One of us was in Hell. The other one only felt that way.</p><p>As I lay there waiting for the morning&#x2019;s first flood of black hopelessness to pass, I heard a scuffling noise on the other side of the wall near my head. I&#x2019;d noticed it earlier when I was going to bed, and had put it down to rats, or possibly one of the neighbors in the adjoining apartment scraping something off the wall. This time it went on for a while, a repetitive <i>skritch-skritch-a-skritch</i> that quickly got on my nerves. Finally I thumped the wall with my fist and everything went silent.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t crazy about my new digs in the downmarket Tierra Green apartments, but things and people that wanted to hurt me kept finding out where I lived, so lately I hadn&#x2019;t been able to stay in any one place for long. And I <i>hate</i> moving.</p><p>Between my girlfriend-on-fire nightmare and the noise in the walls, it took me a good minute or two dunking my head in a sink full of cold water before I could calm down enough to get my mind to focus on work.</p><p><i>Angel advocate</i>, I reminded myself. <i>Somebody needs you.</i></p><p>The client was only a short distance away, out on the Bayshore freeway, but even after I got out of the apartment I couldn&#x2019;t find my car for about ten minutes. Not, I hasten to say, because I had come home drunk (although I might have been a tiny bit fuzzy around the edges) but because after recent experiences with a murderous semi-zombie named Smyler, I&#x2019;d started leaving my ride in a different place every night.</p><p>I felt like I&#x2019;d only managed about ten minutes sleep, but it was almost dawn, which meant I&#x2019;d slept a decent amount: I&#x2019;d passed out almost directly after getting home. Again, not because I&#x2019;d been drinking, although I&#x2019;d probably had a few beers with dinner. (I&#x2019;ve been trying to cut back lately, in fact, be a little more responsible.) No, I was falling asleep at odd hours and forgetting where my car was because I&#x2019;d been sleeping so badly. And I was sleeping badly because I kept dreaming about Hell. See, I&#x2019;d just spent what felt like half a year there, and it was exactly as bad as you&#x2019;d imagine. No, worse. It&#x2019;s not something you just get over in a night. Not to mention the fact that the whole reason I&#x2019;d gone there had been to free the demon-woman I loved, Casimira, the Countess of Cold Hands, and I&#x2019;d failed. Badly. Thus, your pal Bobby&#x2019;s apparently permanent sense of insufficiency, and ugly dreams nearly every night.</p><p>This had been a new one, though, and worse than usual. Usually I just dreamed of Marmora, the fake Caz that the archdemon Eligor had used to sucker me like the smallest small-timer you can imagine, and how she had transformed from Caz into liquid nothing in my arms. Sometimes I also dreamed of the horrible things I&#x2019;d seen happen to Caz while I was being tortured by Eligor, her boss and ex-lover, although I was convinced most of those things hadn&#x2019;t actually happened to her. (I really needed to believe that.) So what had been different about this dream? Caz told me once that when she herself was being executed, she had thought of Joan of Arc, so it only made sense my subconscious would add that nasty wrinkle to the regular pattern of nightmares.</p><p>But there had been something different this time&#x2014;something deeper that I couldn&#x2019;t grasp, almost as though she had truly been trying to communicate with me. But how, why, or about what, I had no clue.</p><p>I found my boxy old Datsun at last, down an alley off Heller Street that I only barely remembered choosing. It was late November but dry and clear, so traffic wasn&#x2019;t too bad even this close to downtown; it took me less than a quarter of an hour to reach the accident scene, just a little way south of the Woodside Expressway cloverleaf. Some kind of minivan with writing on its side lay upside down and badly damaged at the end of a trail of wreckage. Black and whites and emergency vehicles had parked all over the shoulder, lights whipping blue and red. The only body was on the ground, covered with a bloody sheet, and nobody looked like they were in much of a hurry.</p><p>Angel time.</p><p>I left my car on the shoulder about a hundred feet past the accident and walked back through the ice plants. None of the cops gave me a second look as I approached, but that&#x2019;s pretty much how it is: when angels are working, especially at a death scene, we just don&#x2019;t get noticed. Of course, the cops and paramedics were going to see even less of me in a second. When I was within a few yards of the body, I stopped and opened the portal of bright but unsteady light we angels call a Zipper.</p><p>Yes, that&#x2019;s what we call them. Spare me the crude jokes, because believe me, I&#x2019;ve heard them all, mostly from other angels. The Zippers are just an opening we go through to do our work. They&#x2019;re holes in Time, and everything on the other side of them is kind of a bubble made of that single moment.</p><p>The sounds of the freeway died as I stepped through. On the other side, the emergency vehicles and the passing cars, and even the people, had all frozen into place as if a billion gallons of clear plastic had been poured over everything&#x2014;cops halted in mid-gesture, lights frozen at different stages of illumination, an entire universe gone silent as a tomb. Other than me, the only thing moving was a guy in work clothes walking in and out among the motionless cars, pounding on windows, trying to get one of the drivers to notice him. They wouldn&#x2019;t, of course, because he was outside of Time and they were all still inside it.</p><p>He saw me coming and ran toward me. He had a thick mustache and dark skin, but all I could really focus on were the terrified whites of his eyes. &#x201c;Help me!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;I have had an accident!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gurdeep Malhotra,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;God loves you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; he asked, stumbling to a stop.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Doloriel, your angelic advocate.&#x201d; I gave him a moment for that to sink in. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid you didn&#x2019;t survive your accident.&#x201d;</p><p>He stared. If blood had still been flowing in his veins, I&#x2019;d have said he went pale. As it was, he seemed to lose resolution for a moment as the shock washed through him. &#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I can&#x2019;t! My son! It&#x2019;s his&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He shook his head slowly. &#x201c;My wife! Will I never see her again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lot I can&#x2019;t tell you,&#x201d; I said as kindly as I could. In fact, there&#x2019;s a whole lot I don&#x2019;t know myself. &#x201c;But first we have to prepare you for judgement. That&#x2019;s my job. I will do everything I can to defend you. I know you were a good man.&#x201d; (I didn&#x2019;t really know that yet, but it never hurts to calm a client down so you can work with them.)</p><p>He was still staring at me. &#x201c;But you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you are an angel? How can this be? I am not a Christian!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay, Mr. Malhotra. I&#x2019;m not a Christian angel.

A midafternoon storm was building to the south.<br> <br>A statuesque figure with a slim build and bald head, he watched the roiling clouds move toward the Republican Palace. But his thoughts were focused on a different type of storm, one aimed directly at the heart of his suffering country.<br> <br>After nearly four decades of fighting, the rebellious southern region was holding its crucial referendum next month. The outcome was a foregone conclusion. There was no doubt in Namir&#x2019;s mind that the people would vote for independence. They always do, even when it&#x2019;s against their best interests, he thought.<br> <br>John Garang, the deceased leader of the Sudan People&#x2019;s Liberation Army, would finally achieve his goal, albeit from the grave. I hope you&#x2019;re burning in Jahannam for all the pain you caused from your self-righteous, sanctimonious belief in independence, he thought. After all the fighting, it&#x2019;s a helicopter crash that wipes you from the face of the earth.<br> <br>Namir knew better than to think that the South would declare its independence and stop fighting, not with everything at stake along the border. Treasured oil was buried in the territory over which they fought. No peace agreement could prevent further atrocities and bloodshed. It was na�ve to believe otherwise. And I am not na�ve.<br> <br>Independence would be declared, but unimaginable human suffering had become a staple for the Sudanese people in those contested regions.<br> <br>In addition to the war with the South, his government had faced an uprising that started in 2003, when members of the Sudan Liberation Movement, supported by the Darfur Liberation Front, attacked the al-Fashir airfield in western Sudan. They&#x2019;d destroyed four Hind attack gunships and killed most of the soldiers living on the base.<br> <br>Khartoum&#x2019;s response had been swift and severe in the form of a ruthless genocide. They&#x2019;d recruited the Janjaweed militias to exact revenge upon anyone unlucky enough to be associated with the rebels in any way.<br> <br>Namir had personally planned several operations that had resulted in tactical successes&#x2014;with an intentionally large amount of collateral damage and civilian deaths. His methods had pleased his leadership and, ultimately, the president himself. His reward had been his selection to lead the Al Amn al-Dakhili, the organization responsible for Sudan&#x2019;s internal security.<br> <br>Unfortunately, the meddlesome international media had leaked images of the horrors to the United Nations and other intrusive organizations, and Namir had been forced to scale back his aggressive assaults. The UN indictments were jokes to the president and his advisors, reminders of the ineffective bureaucracy and hypocrisy institutionalized in luxurious office buildings in New York City.<br> <br>Neither politics nor moral condemnation from others mattered to Namir. Things had quieted down after the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement with the South and the 2006 agreement with the Sudan Liberation Movement in Darfur.<br> <br>As the director for internal security, his singular responsibility was clear&#x2014;protect the Republic of Sudan and preserve the Islamic way of life. And it was those two duties that had him concerned as he waited for his next appointment.<br> <br>A knock at the door was followed by the sound of creaking hinges as the large, ornate panel to his second-floor office swung inward.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir, your two o&#x2019;clock appointment is here. Shall I bring him in?&#x201d; asked a young female voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, please, Alya. Thank you.&#x201d; He smiled at his secretary and nodded.<br> <br>He turned back toward the enormous double-paned window and noticed that the storm clouds had darkened. So fast. A storm is rare indeed for late December. He stepped away from the view, intending to seat himself behind his desk before his visitor entered. He stopped midstride. His visitor was already here.<br> <br>Standing motionless before him was a young Chinese man who looked no older than twenty-five. He wore dark gray trousers, a white short-sleeve polo&#x2014;well-defined muscles bulging under the sleeves&#x2014;and a pair of black dress shoes tightly laced and impeccably polished.<br> <br>Impressive. I should&#x2019;ve heard him, Namir thought to himself. After years of training and field experience, his senses were sharp. The last person that had surprised him like this had ended up in a Kenyan river with a knife through his rib cage. He smiled at the memory.<br> <br>&#x201c;Major Lau, I presume,&#x201d; Namir said in English and moved toward the young man, hand extended. Major Lau immediately placed both feet together. He extended his right hand in a fist and covered it with his left hand. He nodded slightly and spoke.<br> <br>&#x201c;Director Badawi, it is my distinct honor to make your acquaintance.&#x201d; His delivery and enunciation were as crisp as his appearance.<br> <br>&#x201c;Major Lau, while I appreciate your show of respect, please, have a seat. We have much to discuss.&#x201d; His English is as good as any American&#x2019;s I&#x2019;ve met, Namir thought.<br> <br>The young man relaxed slightly and sat down in a high-back leather chair that faced the window. His posture was purposeful, intended to display a sense of professional confidence. Namir settled into a second chair across from him.<br> <br>He studied the trained soldier and killer, a man who&#x2019;d risen quickly through the ranks of the Ministry of State Security of the People&#x2019;s Republic of China. The MSS was legendary for its ferocious, methodical training. It had recently produced some of the most ruthless and successful undercover intelligence agents in the world. The one in his office was supposed to be one of the best they&#x2019;d developed. He would tread carefully.<br> <br>&#x201c;Major Lau, your terms have been agreed to. The only question I have left is the time line. How soon can it be done? The referendum is only a few weeks away, and I&#x2019;d like to advise my president as soon as this joint mission is complete. He&#x2019;ll never know the details&#x2014;just the end result. But it has to be soon, or we won&#x2019;t be able to control it. Do you understand?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir, I completely&#x2014;&#x201d; was all Major Lau uttered before Namir interrupted him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please, call me Namir. This partnership is unofficial. There is no record of this meeting, of my phone conversations with your government, of any of this. If there were and were we to be discovered, we&#x2019;d both end up indicted by that worthless International Court at The Hague. I&#x2019;ve been doing this a long time. I know what you are, and I assume you know what I am. We&#x2019;re both professionals. Agreed?&#x201d;<br> <br>Major Lau exhaled and released some of the tension in his frame, a dangerous but genuine smile gracing his features. &#x201c;As you wish, Namir. Please call me Gang, and I do have a time line. If all goes as planned&#x2014;although you and I both know it hardly ever does&#x2014;we will have confirmation and positive control well before the referendum. Once we do, it should provide you with guaranteed security, no matter what the South does.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How soon can you begin?&#x201d; Namir inquired quietly.<br> <br>&#x201c;My men are here, and I&#x2019;ve been informed that the software and equipment should be acquired within the next twenty-four hours. Once they have it, it will be shipped to a safe location, transported over land in our control, and flown here directly via private charter,&#x201d; Gang said.<br> <br>Namir raised his eyebrows, an unspoken question forming on his lips.<br> <br>&#x201c;There is no electronic trail of the shipment,&#x201d; Gang said, reading his subtle expression. &#x201c;I assure you. I&#x2019;ll have a team I personally selected accompany it the entire time once it reaches Europe. I should have it in my custody in no more than five days.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gang hadn&#x2019;t told Namir about the second team in the US&#x2014;a team with a different but related mission&#x2014;that had gone dark, and he didn&#x2019;t need to. It was that part of the operation that had him concerned. The upcoming American holiday season and the general focus on other threats to their homeland were weaknesses he intended to exploit. Once he gave the order, there would be no turning back.<br> <br>&#x201c;If this operation succeeds,&#x201d; Gang said, &#x201c;and there&#x2019;s no reason to believe it won&#x2019;t&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve secured additional measures just in case&#x2014;the prosperity of our countries will be guaranteed for decades to come, our financial fates sealed and intertwined.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gang was confident they&#x2019;d be successful, but success was not enough. He wanted to humiliate the United States on the global stage. American arrogance would wither under the Chinese technological and industrial heel. A new world order was barreling toward the globe, a freight train of change and equality. He felt the fury rise in his stomach, a feeling he experienced at every glimpse of the American flag, a hypocritical symbol of opulence and superficiality.<br> <br>Namir nodded thoughtfully. The plan was sound and compartmented. The president and the first vice president had plausible deniability if things went wrong. And with as many moving parts as this operation had, things easily could go awry. Glory is reserved only for those willing to seize it.<br> <br>The stage was set, the actors in place, and it was time for the curtain to open. &#x201c;In that case, Gang, let&#x2019;s begin.&#x201d; He grinned broadly, his own smile as cunningly lethal as the young killer&#x2019;s.</p><h2>Conspiracy: A True Story of Power, Sex, and a Billionaire&#39;s Secret Plot to Destroy a Media Empire</h2><p><b>An NPR Book Concierge Best Book of 2018!<br><br>A <i>Sunday Times</i> of London Pick of the Paperbacks<br><br>A stunning story about how power works in the modern age--the book the New York Times called "one helluva page-turner" and The Sunday Times of London celebrated as "riveting...an astonishing modern media conspiracy that is a fantastic read." Pick up the book everyone is talking about.</b><br><br>In 2007, a short blogpost on Valleywag, the Silicon Valley-vertical of Gawker Media, outed PayPal founder and billionaire investor Peter Thiel as gay. Thiel's sexuality had been known to close friends and family, but he didn't consider himself a public figure, and believed the information was private. <br><br>This post would be the casus belli for a meticulously plotted conspiracy that would end nearly a decade later with a $140 million dollar judgment against Gawker, its bankruptcy and with Nick Denton, Gawker's CEO and founder, out of a job. Only later would the world learn that Gawker's demise was not incidental--it had been masterminded by Thiel.<br><br>For years, Thiel had searched endlessly for a solution to what he'd come to call the "Gawker Problem." When an unmarked envelope delivered an illegally recorded sex tape of Hogan with his best friend's wife, Gawker had seen the chance for millions of pageviews and to say the things that others were afraid to say. Thiel saw their publication of the tape as the opportunity he was looking for. He would come to pit Hogan against Gawker in a multi-year proxy war through the Florida legal system, while Gawker remained confidently convinced they would prevail as they had over so many other lawsuit--until it was too late. <br><br>The verdict would stun the world and so would Peter's ultimate unmasking as the man who had set it all in motion. Why had he done this? How had no one discovered it? What would this mean--for the First Amendment? For privacy? For culture?<br><br>In Holiday's masterful telling of this nearly unbelievable conspiracy, informed by interviews with all the key players, this case transcends the narrative of how one billionaire took down a media empire or the current state of the free press. It's a study in power, strategy, and one of the most wildly ambitious--and successful--secret plots in recent memory.<br><br>Some will cheer Gawker's destruction and others will lament it, but after reading these pages--and seeing the access the author was given--no one will deny that there is something ruthless and brilliant about Peter Thiel's shocking attempt to shake up the world.</p><p><b>RYAN HOLIDAY&nbsp;</b>is the bestselling author of<i>&nbsp;Trust Me, I&#x2019;m Lying</i>;&nbsp;<i>The Obstacle Is the Way</i>;&nbsp;<i>Ego Is the Enemy</i>;&nbsp;<i>Conspiracy</i>&nbsp;and other books about marketing, culture, and the human condition.

He lives in Austin, Texas.<b>Chapter 1: The Inciting Incident<br></b><br> "The beginnings of all things are small," Cicero reminds us. What becomes powerful or significant often begins inauspiciously, and so, too, do the causes that eventually pit powerful forces against one another.<br><br> The conflict at the heart of this story is no different. Its genesis is a largely obvious, mostly unremarkable blog post-not even four hundred words long-that outed a little-known technology investor as homosexual. Written by a gossip blogger named Owen Thomas, for a now-defunct tech news website owned by Gawker called Valleywag, the piece was published at 7:05 p.m. on December 19, 2007, under a headline that would sear itself into the mind of its subject:<br><br> Peter Thiel Is Totally Gay, People.<br><br> It wouldn't be fair to say, as some partisans have in the intervening years, that Owen Thomas was some reckless blogger who plucked some private citizen from nowhere for his story. He'd been a reporter for over a decade, and Peter Thiel had a media profile as an investor and an entrepreneur. Thiel had made a fortune as a founder of PayPal and put the first $500,000 into Facebook. The man had previously posed for photographers and agreed to be interviewed by reporters who were covering him or his companies. And it was not disputable that he was, in fact, gay.<br><br> Peter admits that his sexuality was no revelation. "I think everyone already knew in 2007," he told me. By that he means that his parents knew he was gay. His friends knew and so did his colleagues. But it was not a fact he advertised. A friend would say that Peter burned to be the best technology investor in the world. To insert "gay" into that, to be seen as the best gay technology investor, seemed artificially limiting. Like it was cheating him of something he was desperate to earn. And so Peter Thiel's sexuality stood as a kept but open secret in the close-knit community of the Silicon Valley elite.<br><br> To the modern mind, this reticent gay identity seems like an anachronism, but when you do the math, you quickly realize how different the world was in 2007. The Democrat who would be elected president in less than a year's time was still five years away from announcing his support for same-sex marriage. The woman who opposed him in the primary would take an additional year to come around. 2007 was also much closer to the burst of the dot-com bubble than it is to the present day. Facebook's IPO lay five years in the future and most of the astonishing success of this class of start-ups from Twitter to Netflix still lay ahead.<br><br> While Thiel was not no one in late 2007 when the story broke, Peter Thiel was not then Peter Thiel. He was not the person he would be at the end of this story, the idiosyncratic lion of Silicon Valley venture capital or controversial political power broker. Thiel was more like all the other technology investors most people have never heard of. Do the names Max Levchin or Roelof Botha sound familiar to the average person? They were Thiel's partners in PayPal. Or the name Jim Breyer? He put a million dollars in Facebook less than a year after Thiel put in his half million. What about Maurice Werdegar, who put in money with Thiel in that famous seed round? Few have even heard of these people, let alone cared whom they slept with. They are, as far as popular culture is concerned, as Thiel was then, barely notable. And he was, above all, a quiet, private person.<br><br> When one considers Thiel's burning ambitions against this backdrop, and the potential for this Valleywag story to be the first thing to broadly define him outside the Valley, one might better understand Thiel's reaction to Owen Thomas's small, unexceptional story and the flippant headline that went with it.<br><br> "It was like a full-on attack out of the blue. There was nothing I had ever done to these people in any way whatsoever. On a superficial level, the article was just about outing me," Peter said. It wasn't the outing itself, however, that most got to him, but the second narrative, that he has psychological problems because he didn't want to be outed. "It was never about the Owen Thomas article," Thiel eventually admitted to me. "It was the Nick Denton comment."<br><br> In the comments section at the bottom of Owen Thomas's story, Nick Denton, Valleywag's editor and the founder of its parent company, Gawker Media, had posted a few sentences in the form of an accusation that seemed to respond to itself: "The only thing that's strange about Thiel's sexuality: why on earth was he so paranoid about its discovery for so long?"<br><br> By normal, journalistic standards, this commentary would be extraordinary. For a founder and publisher to editorialize and speculate from the peanut gallery of his publication's own comments section? Yet by 2007, this kind of combative, adversarial approach to the news and its subjects was standard operating procedure for the somber, perpetually scruffy Englishman with cherubic cheeks, a love of technology, and a passion for gossip.<br><br> Even those who hate Nick Denton would describe him as brilliant. Born Nicholas Guido Anthony Denton to a British economist father and psychotherapist mother of Jewish-Hungarian descent, Denton attended Oxford University. He sold his first company, a networking group for people in the tech industry, for millions. When he started his online media company in 2002, his love for tech was at the forefront of his mission: Gizmodo, the first of the many sites that would comprise his publishing empire, was a "vertical blog devoted to superskinny laptops, spy cameras, wireless wizardry, and all manner of other toys for overgrown boys. All gadgets, all the time."<br><br> Roughly four months later, he launched a new site dedicated to his other, more primal passion: secrets and gossip. He named it Gawker. Technology may have been Denton's first love, but many would say this-his lust to expose, to reveal, to lob bombs-was Denton's true love, a side of him that ran parallel to his urge to build. He would name his celebrity site Defamer (one blogger joked, "Why not go all the way and call it 'Defendant'!"), and he would name his porn site Fleshbot, but it was Gawker that would stick as the name of the parent company, since it so well described the editorial ethos of Denton's online empire and captured the pathos of its founder perfectly.<br><br> Gawker's first editor, Elizabeth Spiers, was paid $2,000 per month for twelve posts a day, seven days a week. Her job was to mock the club of New York elites she had never been invited to join. Her job was to, with a kind of humorous contempt that's come to be called snark, dismiss people and institutions as laughably unimportant, even as, in writing about them, she was in fact admitting how important they actually were (and that perhaps, deep down, she'd like to join them some day). Denton had a knack for recruiting talent like her, and for cultivating their voices as he did with Spiers and, eventually, Owen Thomas. He liked young writers with drive and wit, and a gift for pointing at hypocrisy and vulnerabilities that brought audiences quickly and cheaply. Within six months, Denton's sites were pulling in more than 500,000 page views a month. Within a year, the blogs were making more than $2,000 per month each; within three years they were estimated to be generating at least $120,000 in advertising revenue per month. A little over ten years into Gawker's run, its revenues would be nearly $40 million a year and the sites would have more than 40 million readers a month. Denton had struck a rich and dark vein. He had harnessed a modern, digital take on the old tabloid sensibility that, George W. S. Trow once observed, requires a sort of "back and forth of loathe and love of old authority." This pinging between self-pity and self-importance would be Gawker's secret formula.<br><br> "As a publishing entrepreneur who built an operation out of nothing, I had to go where the energy was," Denton would say. That energy was mostly the energy of disillusioned youth, of outsiders criticizing insiders. In being anti this and that, and rarely for something else instead. Mankind has always crucified and burned, a great playwright once said. We take a secret pleasure in the misfortune of our friends, said another wise man. For Gawker it was no secret pleasure but a conspicuous one and to it they added the power of blogging. Nick's instincts were captured and compounded by the economics of his instruments: twenty-something writers with school debt and little income. Overeducated children of Boomers, the children of parents whose idealism became materialism, the writers believed they had something to say because those same parents had told them they were special and important and talented.<br><br> Previous generations of writers came to New York City with a dream. This generation came with a bone to pick-for the broken economy, for the collapse of old industries, for the hypocrisy and fakeness that had finally become acute. They wanted a seat at the Algonquin and ended up sharing a bedroom in Bushwick, writing twenty articles a week (nineteen of which no one would read) for $12 apiece. Of course they were pissed. A New York Times writer would later dub this ethos the "rage of the creative underclass." A Gawker headline captures it better: "It's OK to Be a Hater Because Everything Is Bad."<br><br> The existentialists spoke of ressentiment, or the way that resentment creates frustration which fuels more resentment. Philosophers might have said this feeling was pointless, but they knew it was a fearful force. Gawker would revel in ressentiment, of its writers and readers. Like most movements that harness the power of an underappreciated class, the environment was temperamental and volatile, but you could not argue that the results were not also entertaining and forceful. Especially when combined with financial incentives.<br><br> Denton experimented with different forms of compensation in the early years, but his most important shift was away from a raw number of posts per day (how many things can you make fun of today) toward page views (how many people agree with what you're making fun of). Denton's mind gravitates toward small publishing innovations like these. His sites were some of the first to post the view count at the top of the article. He notices that his writers obsess over this number, refreshing the stat counter over and over, and begins to pay them accordingly. He puts up a large screen in the office that ranks the writers and the articles based on traffic. He calls it the "NASDAQ of Content," but it's closer to the millennial id. If the untapped energy of young people was his first great breakthrough, this is his second. The first offers the power of being heard, the second provides the power of reach and then of quantification-turning blogging into something you can win. How? By getting the most readers. With what? That's for you to decide.<br><br> What Denton did, in effect, was turn writing, social commentary, and journalism into a video game. Writing wasn't a craft you mastered. It was a delivery mechanism. The people and companies you wrote about, like Peter Thiel, weren't people, they were characters on a screen-fodder for your weekly churn. And the people you got to read this writing? They were points. The score was right there next to your byline. Views: 1,000. 10,000. 100,000. 1,000,000. The highest prize, the best ticket to traffic? Scandalum magnatum-going after great men and women. But in a bind, and with so many posts to get out each day, ordinary people would do just as well.<br><br> Gawker Stalker: Elijah Wood Emphatically Not a Gay<br><br> Joe Dolce: Portrait of an Asshat<br><br> Danyelle Freeman Sucks: The Marrow Out of Life, in General<br><br> Which NYC Food Critic Is an Idiot?

Maybe when the kid's name is Elijah Pollack," and tagged it "The Sins of Their Fathers," they were practicing journalism by tomahawk. And it isn't scoops that the sites were looking for, it was scalps: who can we get, who did something stupid, what are other people afraid to say, and who are they afraid to say it about?<br><br> If a piece didn't go hard enough, if there were rumors the reporter wanted to talk about but couldn't justify even with Gawker's thin standards, there was always the comments section to push the story from behind-or the bottom, as it were-and drum up tips and speculation and titillation that might lead to more attention. It had always been Nick's nature to push deeper, to speculate, to needle, to drill down to the interesting stuff-and there was no deeper well of ressentiment than the endless scroll of the comments section.<br><br> It was all great fun for him, for his writers. Why wouldn't it be? Especially when the old guard yells at you, and you are the type who takes that as a sign you're doing everything right. Journalists, competitors, and leaders alike criticized this editorial style that Nick had invented. Watchdogs were on the lookout for the first Gawker victim suicide. Some inside Gawker even shared these concerns. But it cannot be said that readers didn't love Gawker. There was a unique freeness to what Gawker wrote, a kind of raw unfiltered honesty, an exaggerated way of telling the truth. Peter Thiel is totally gay, people! If something was true, if they thought something was true, they published it. The writers said the things that people thought in private-they fulfilled their wishes. They gave their readers-the people who made up those numbers at the top of each post-what their own bitterness and ressentiment had always craved but no one had seen fit to give them before.<br><br> A movie executive once described the "honeyed sting" of the notorious twentieth-century gossip Hedda Hopper as a black widow spider crossed with a scorpion, weaned on prussic acid and treacle. In a way, that was Gawker, too. The perfect conduit for the envy and schadenfreude and jockeying for power that goes on in this world. It's why their tip lines were never dry.</p><h2>Milkman</h2><p><p><b>Liberty fabric covered editions bring classics from the Faber backlist together with important modern titles, putting them in conversation and celebrating both the history and the future of Faber &amp; Faber. </b></p><br><p>In this unnamed city, to be interesting is dangerous.

But few of those parents ever attach this hope to an ongoing plan; therefore, they fail to lay a reliable spiritual track in front of the fast-moving train of family life. This book is a junction point where deep parental desire meets workable design and where timid inadequacy meets Christ&#x2019;s sufficiency. It&#x2019;s where individual families become multiplication factories, exerting a lasting impact not only on their coming generations but even on the culture at large.</p><p>The death of Joshua and his contemporaries was barely old news in Israel before the people of God experienced a Judges 2:10 moment: &#x201c;There arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord or the work that he had done&#x201d; (ESV).

Who doesn&#x2019;t just pretend at faith but actually lives it. Kids who can tell you what they believe and why it matters. Teenagers who handle adversity with the resilient joy of godly wisdom. A family who prays together and worships together, growing into young adults who are equipped and inspired to keep this torch ablaze from the moment their own new families begin.</p><p>This book is here to make that reality happen, written by an author equipped with not only a passion for the concept but also a proven plan for success&#x2014;a wealth of first-hand personal stories from his wife and kids for how they&#x2019;ve put this plan into living action with remarkable blessings in tow.

In ink renderings on pages that maintain interest by alternating between black on white and the perception of the reverse, the boy contrasts the sense of being small&#x2014;evoked when he sees rich and famous people&#x2014;with the power he wields with his pen. The "Dali" headline on the book jacket's folded newspaper boat foreshadows playful bits of surrealism, e.g., an elephant in a teacup, a man who looms large on the left page in the hand of a small girl on the right. This tender composition has a familial, personal feeling. The versatile drawing instrument worries about war, expresses love, and "wears satellite sneakers with computer laces." Myers intersperses literal depictions of the pen at work (creating the child's face) with images that are described in more fanciful terms. Where the artist is walking upside down (no pen in sight), the text reads: "My pen tap-dances on the sky and draws clouds with its feet." The first-person possessive voice wears a little thin, and the connection among the pages is loose. Nevertheless, Myers has assembled a visually arresting array of sketches that will likely attract the interest of children who enjoy drawing themselves. Indeed, the last sentence is an invitation to "Let those worlds inside your pen out!"

He originally intended to become a doctor and earned his degree before turning to what was then a medium for children. His many early masterpieces include the series known in the U.S. as <i>Astro Boy</i>. With his sweeping vision, deftly interwined plots, feel for the workings of power, and indefatigable commitment to human dignity, Tezuka elevated manga to an art form. The later Tezuka, when he authored Buddha, often had in mind the mature readership that manga gained in the sixties and that had only grown ever since. The Kurosawa of Japanese pop culture, Osamu Tezuka is a twentieth century classic."Infused with humor and history, the epic of Siddhartha is perhaps Osamu Tezuka's crowning acheivement and illustrates why, without irony, Tezuka is referred to as 'The King of Japanese Comics'." -<b><i> LA Weekly</i></b>"Buddha is one of Tezuka's true masterpieces.

In <i>Mary and the Art of Prayer,</i> Rachel Fulton Brown traces the history of the medieval practice of praising Mary through the complex of prayers known as the Hours of the Virgin. More than just a work of comprehensive historical scholarship, the book asks readers to immerse themselves in the experience of believing in and praying to Mary. <i>Mary and the Art of Prayer</i> crosses the boundaries that modern scholars typically place between observation and experience, between the world of provable facts and the world of imagination, suggesting what it would have been like for medieval Christians to encounter Mary in prayer.<br><br><i>Mary and the Art of Prayer </i>opens with a history of the devotion of the Hours or &#x201c;Little Office&#x201d; of the Virgin. It then guides readers in the practice of saying this Office, including its invitatory (<i>Ave Maria</i>), antiphons, psalms, lessons, and prayers. The book works on several levels at once. It provides a new methodology for thinking about devotion and prayer; a new appreciation of the scope of and audience for the Hours of the Virgin; a new understanding of how Mary functions theologically and devotionally; and a new reading of sources not previously taken into account. A courageous and moving work, it will transform our ideas of what scholarship is and what it can accomplish.</p><p>Rachel Fulton Brown is associate professor of history at the University of Chicago. She is the author of <i>From Judgment to Passion: Devotion to Christ and the Virgin Mary, 800&#x2013;1200 </i>(2002) and coeditor of <i>History in the Comic Mode: Medieval Communities and the Matter of Person </i>(2007), both from Columbia University Press.This volume is a stunning accomplishment&#x2015;beautifully written, scholarly, and inspiring. Using medieval sources, it gives a detailed presentation of how the man or woman of the late Middle Ages may have read a book of hours. The resonances and allusions of each word and image are teased out so that the modern reader is able to engage the ancient devotion from, as it were, the inside. Both secular scholars and theologians will find their work enriched by reading <i>Mary and the Art of Prayer</i>. It leads the reader into the world of late medieval religious practice and sets an excellent example of method for future research. (Sarah Jane Boss, director of the Centre for Marian Studies, author of <i>The Spirit of Mary</i>)<br><br>Deliberately (and often delightfully) provocative, Rachel Fulton Brown&#x2019;s book takes on Hilda Graef&#x2019;s classic <i>Mary: A History of Doctrine and Devotion </i>(1963-65) as its sparring partner. Fulton Brown highlights thirteenth-century Mariological writings that Graef treats only briefly and dismissively: Conrad of Saxony&#x2019;s <i>Speculum Beatae Mariae Virginis, </i>Richard of Saint-Laurent&#x2019;s <i>De Laudibus Sanctae Mariae, </i>and the famous <i>Mariale Super Missus Est </i>(until 1952, attributed to Albert the Great). Countering Graef&#x2019;s criticisms of these works as &#x201c;questionable,&#x201d; &#x201c;popular,&#x201d; &#x201c;unhealthy,&#x201d; and manifesting &#x201c;signs of decadence,&#x201d; Fulton Brown endeavors mightily to recover them as reflective of the theological vitality of an age deeply inspired by the Wisdom tradition of the Bible and by the prayer life of the faithful. (Ann Astell, author of <i>Eating Beauty: The Eucharist and the Spiritual Arts of the Middle Ages</i>)<br><br><i>Mary and the Art of Prayer</i> brings medieval Marian devotions before the readers&#x2019; eyes and elucidates the profound meanings in and spiritual preparations for serving the Virgin&#x2015;Holy Wisdom, Queen of Heaven, and Container of Creation&#x2015;through observance of her Hours. Rachel Fulton Brown&#x2019;s historical imagination is informed by brilliant scholarship, and her evocative prose rests easily beside citations of beauteous psalms. (Georgiana Donavin, author of <i>Scribit Mater: Mary and the Language Arts in the Literature of Medieval England</i>)<br><br><i>Mary and the Art of Prayer</i> is packed with information and insight, inviting the reader not just to examine medieval devotion to Mary but to experience that devotion. Medieval Christians had a rich and ancient tradition of devotion to the Lady of the Jerusalem temple. The reader is deftly drawn into the candle-lit Middle Ages, to read the Scriptures as the faithful read them, and to pray with them, not just to examine their practice of prayer. Based on many years of research, <i>Mary and the Art of Prayer </i>offers a huge collection of devotional material, all translated into English. Much of this is little known outside specialist circles. This book is a labor of love, written with real understanding. (Margaret Barker, author of <i>The Great Angel</i> and <i>The Mother of the Lord</i>)<br><br>No persuasive account of the Virgin can now ignore the liturgical and exegetical sources on which [Brown] lavishes such scrupulous care. And more than fifty years after Vatican II, the Council&#x2019;s Mariology is ripe for reassessment. <i>Mary and the Art of Prayer</i> could well be a game-changer in that conversation. (<i>Speculum</i>)<br><br>Given both its size and unique methodology,<i> Mary and the Art of Prayer</i> will challenge its readers to reconsider how they interpret the categories of 'medieval', 'imagination' and 'devotion'. (Rebekah Lamb <i>Catholic Herald</i>)<br><br>This book is the product of massive and original scholarship....the book requires an almost total rethinking of how we look on Mary today, this in the light of how medieval Christians understood her.

Not just for artists, this book is an avenue into art for people who have never painted and may even have been told they 'can't paint' at an early age, but who love the idea of playing with colour as a distraction from the stresses of modern life.<br><br>All of Jean's books have promoted the energising and mood-lifting effects of painting, and this aspect of her writing is brought into sharp focus in Paint Yourself Positive. It will encourage the reader to take up painting as a wonderful hobby that can transform your life.</p><p>A member of the Society for Women Artists (SWA), international watercolourist Jean Haines is well-known for her love of her chosen medium. Having lived and travelled in many countries, this popular artist has had the opportunity to develop her skills whilst under the influence of masters from many countries, including Asia, the Middle East and Europe. She studied brush control while living in China and this had the greatest impact on her style. The magical free flow of water and colour straight on to a blank working surface (with no initial drawing) creates amazing results, often leaving her audience breathless with delight.

While setting up an exhibit of handmade quilts, she stumbles upon the body of a brutally stabbed artist. Hoping to conduct an investigation on her own, she crosses paths with the local police chief, who thinks this short and sassy cowgirl should leave detecting to the cops and join him for dinner. But it&#39;s hard to keep a country girl down, and soon Benni uncovers an alarming pattern of family secrets, small-town lies--and the shocking truth about the night her husband died...</p><p><b>Earlene Fowler</b> was raised in La Puente, California, by a Southern mother and a Western father. She lives in Southern California with her husband, Allen, a large number of quilts, and twenty pairs of cowboy boots.Young, recently widowed Benni Harper, the foolhardy heroine in this predictable debut, leaves her ranch after her husband's accidental death and becomes the curator of the folk-art museum in the coastal California town of San Celina. Benni is frantically trying to assemble a quilt show when she discovers a local potter stabbed to death in the museum studio. Benni's flaky 21-year-old cousin Rita, whom Benni had seen driving away from the museum, disappears and becomes a prime suspect. When Rita calls asking for money, Benni determines not to tell the police, whose new chief, Gabe Ortiz, has warned her not to interfere in the investigation, and decides to clear Rita by finding the real murderer. The day that the quilt show opens, Benni finds a plastic bag filled with money in the attic of the museum but waits to tell Ortiz until after the opening party. When he goes to the attic to investigate, he finds, instead, the body of the museum handyman. Fowler connects all the deaths in her plot, leaving no threads hanging, but Benni's reckless actions and her love-hate relationship with the enigmatic Ortiz yield an unconvincing narrative.

Ashley Mae Hoiland bids us follow her down the hallowed and well-trodden path between the heart and mind, where glimpses of godliness are discovered in rainstorms, bus rides, temples, and mountains. As a Latter-day Saint, Hoiland explores the complexities of faith in everyday life where laughter and creativity matter as much as faith, hope, and charity.</p><p>Ashley Mae Hoiland received a bachelor of fine arts degree in studio arts and a master of fine arts degree in poetry from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. She teaches art in low-income elementary schools in California and has written and illustrated several children s books. She is founder of We Brave Women an initiative to educate youth about important historical and contemporary women.Through her exquisite poetry and prose, Ashley Mae Hoiland offers what she aptly terms the sacred writ of my life. Her intensely personal stories capture the experiences of daughter, sister, wife, mother, missionary, friend, and stranger all framed within her thoughtful explorations of belief and being. This spiritual autobiography is richly textured with honesty, compassion, and reverence. There is no trite homily here, but rather an abundance of finely turned phrases to ponder. The spare words make their own music while simple line drawings accentuate the poet s artistry. Hoiland s reflections are very female and very Mormon, but she sounds a universal ring in her struggle to find God and embrace all God s children in a world that both is and is not perfect. There is wonder here, and wholeness and holiness, that carries the reader into his or her own soul. --Jill Mulvay Derr, Coeditor of <i>Eliza R. Snow: The Complete Poetry</i><br><br>This is simply the most artful and perceptive writing about Mormonism I have encountered in a long, long time. The impressionistic glimpses that Ashley Mae Hoiland offers into her experience as a Latter-day Saint woman are clear-eyed, generous, and moving. Through her eyes one gets a sense not only of delight in the beauty of the world and in the love and power of a Heavenly Father and Mother, but also mourning for the loneliness and difficulty that shape human experience, often in such uneven ways. Hoiland s deep love and appreciation for Mormonism, the house whose halls I know best, shines forth from every page, alongside her loyal sympathy for those who carry deep wounds from their encounters at church. Hoiland s accounts of teenage spiritual searching, missionary adventure, motherhood, and her wrestle with gender issues in Mormon culture are familiar yet startlingly luminous as she paints a tender, sympathetic portrait of the many fellow travelers who have lifted and taught her along the way. --Melissa Wei-Tsing Inouye, Associate editor of the <i>Mormon Studies Review</i><br><br>"Ashley Mae Hoiland has found God in places that most of us never think to look: in cruelty and poverty, in emptiness and desire, and in people whose divinity is buried deep within all-too-human frames. She shapes her stories of searching and discovery into elegant prose poems recalling the work of Sandra Cisneros and Terry Tempest Williams. But Hoiland s voice is wholly original. Her journeys through landscapes of faith end in neither certainty nor doubt, but in a mature and reflective faith at home in the spaces between. Contemporary Mormonism needs Hoiland s stories and example. In this compulsively readable work of art, she teaches us how to turn the raw experiences of a life into beautiful things, and then she shows us, as only a true artist can, how those beautiful things can also be holy." --Michael Austin, Author of <i>Re-reading Job: Understanding the Ancient World s Greatest Poem</i></p><h2>Refuel: A 24-Day Eating Plan to Shed Fat, Boost Testosterone, and Pump Up Strength and Stamina</h2><p><b>LOW T?

I was flying high professionally, but I wasn&#x2019;t taking care of myself. I inhaled highly processed foods mindlessly at work: bags of bagels and pints of cream cheese, egg rolls, doughnuts, pizza. I grabbed whatever I could eat and kept moving.<br><br>I tried to weekend-warrior my way out of my weight, but that of course didn&#x2019;t work. So there I was: 35 pounds overweight, with many of the early symptoms of aging. I noticed newly sprouting gray hair, I had a big gut, and I didn&#x2019;t like what I saw in the mirror. My uncle had died of diabetes at age 48, and I was starting to pee more and felt hungry all the time. I knew I could be developing diabetes and that what I was eating was aging me, physically and mentally. But I didn&#x2019;t know how to stop the process, let alone reverse it.<br><br>On top of wanting to change for myself, I also felt a responsibility to change for my patients. How could I help them effectively when I couldn&#x2019;t make improvements in my own life?<br><br>The Fat Doctor Paradox<br><br>Ever been startled by the sight of a doctor lighting up? I have. But does the sight of an obese doctor give you the same jolt? It should.<br><br>Researchers with Johns Hopkins University&#x2019;s Bloomberg School of Public Health revealed in a study that a physician&#x2019;s weight can impact the type of care and information he or she issues to patients. After surveying doctors across the country, they found &#x201c;normal-weight physicians&#x201d; were more likely to discuss weight loss, diet, and exercise with their heavy patients. Only 7 percent of overweight physicians (individuals with a body mass index, or BMI, of 25 or more) recorded an obesity diagnosis on any patient versus 93 percent of normal-weight doctors.<br><br>My own research in this area reveals that doctors face huge challenges in the workplace. Free meals are in constant supply at many hospitals. Nutritional quality is not always considered&#x2014;and I am being generous in my assessment here. To be more accurate, most hospital food seems designed to cause heart disease and other illness, not to prevent it.<br><br>By no means does this cancel out the care you receive from an overweight doctor or a fast-food-franchise-hosting hospital. But it does bring to light the fact that doctors are far from perfect, and that acquiring or building upon your self-care survival skills is never a bad idea.<br><br>I knew enough about the science of aging and weight gain to recognize that nutrition (or lack of it) had landed me in my current state, so I went straight to the source: food. But I didn&#x2019;t want to simply put on my medical scientist&#x2019;s hat. I wanted to learn a new skill: to understand food from a tactile sense, to see natural ingredients in their natural form. I wanted to approach food as a chef would, so I did the most obvious thing: I went to cooking school.<br><br>In cooking, I finally found a professional niche that also helped serve my personal goals. I was eating better than ever&#x2014;in both taste and nutrition&#x2014;and my body, appearance, and energy level reflected this change. I lost most of my big gut, and many of the external signs of aging that had begun to reveal themselves prematurely retreated. I felt my sense of purpose renewed.<br><br>Hot Tip<br><br>Soft, smooth skin and diminished underarm hair can signal low testosterone.<br><br>From there, and with my friend Dr. Mike Roizen, I became the first physician to teach nutrition and cooking together in a medical school. We went on to research and co-write a popular book, The RealAge Diet. <br><br>I took this momentum to re-invent my individual practice, Chef Clinic�, where I began to offer patients my hands-on, strategic plan for achieving better health through weight loss. I started collecting good stories, and writing down the details of my calls from patients. They were losing weight and doing things that they had never thought about doing. A few examples:<br><br>�A 72-year-old from Washington, D.C., called me after reaching the bottom of the Grand Canyon, over nine miles from where he had begun.<br><br>�A 54-year-old let me know he no longer needed to use seat belt extenders, and had to push his car&#x2019;s driver&#x2019;s seat forward because it was too far from the steering wheel.<br><br>�A 48-year-old had to take two links out of his metal wristwatch because it became too loose; he noticed this when the tan line around his watch began to show&#x2014;it was the tan line that caught his eye.<br><br>�A 39-year-old reported being able to pull the airplane tray table down without hitting his stomach.<br><br>My professional and personal passions united in my practice. I could now blend the pleasure of writing recipes on prescription slips with the chance to empower motivated people to transform their lives.<br><br>As I continued work in my practice, I began to see a pattern emerge&#x2014;it was mostly men who were coming to me, and they were achieving knockout, sustained results.<br><br>I knew this was a statistical anomaly. Men notoriously shy away from &#x201c;diets&#x201d; and balk at traditional dieting rules. Counting points or calories, eating smaller portions, and consuming low-fat, low-sugar, low-flavor versions of everything aren&#x2019;t concepts that bring most men to the table. But something about my approach was not only bringing them to the table, it was helping them embrace this gut-free, pain-free, ready-for-action solution. And sometimes, they got to leave behind the pill bottles they no longer needed.<br><br>Hot Tip<br><br>Losing just 10 pounds can lower your blood pressure. Track your pressure at home and show your doctor the numbers. Decide together whether you can adjust your medication.<br><br>Refuel Emerges<br><br>In writing this book, I went back and re-read and analyzed the file of every man I&#x2019;ve treated over the last fifteen years, paying attention to what worked for each and what didn&#x2019;t. I analyzed thousands of peer-reviewed clinical reports in metabolism and endocrinology to find the science behind the most successful strategies. I read all of the comments on my ChefMD� and Paging Dr. La Puma blogs and the recipe postings from over 30,000 subscribers. (Join them! Sign up at www.refuelmen.com for tools and advice.)<br><br>After all that research, one fact struck me immediately: there is no such thing as a unisex diet. If a man wants to lose weight, a diet designed to help women will not usually work.<br><br>When it comes to the subject of weight, men and women couldn&#x2019;t be more different. Not only do men feel differently about food, we metabolize it differently, carry our weight differently, store our fat differently, and burn fat differently and at different rates with exercise. We have completely different attitudes toward and expectations of weight-control programs.<br><br>Man Memo<br><br>Men who went to exclusively male weight-loss meetings lost twice as much weight as those who attended co-ed meetings.<br><br>These differences are obvious when you look at many current diet books and programs. Nearly all popular diets and diet books have been written for women. Almost no programs have been created just for men to meet their distinct medical, physiological, and behavioral needs. That is, until now.<br><br>Man Memo<br><br>Men generally have greater muscle mass and lower body fat than women. More muscle and less fat means men need 10 to 15 percent more calories than their female counterparts to maintain their weight.<br><br>What you&#x2019;re looking at in this book is a scientifically sound and clinically proven weight-loss and weight-maintenance program designed specifically for men. It makes guys feel better, right away. It shows them how to ratchet their efforts up to the next level, without cutting out whole food groups as fad diets do, and without getting overwhelmed by a lot of the science that is not all that relevant to the subject at hand.<br><br>The program sticks to the science you actually need to keep you on track, to catch you if you fall, and to let your body work efficiently so you can lose the gut. The program is also about self-improvement: it allows your inherent but occasionally dormant confidence in yourself and your life purpose to re-emerge.<br><br>Before I dive into the details of the program, let&#x2019;s rewind for a quick macro view of men&#x2019;s health today. You will see, if you don&#x2019;t already do so when you look in the mirror, why it&#x2019;s more important than ever that you reprogram your body and recharge your life.<br><br>The Epidemic of the Mid-Waist Crisis<br><br>Throughout the United States, nearly three out of four men are at an unhealthy weight. In fact, there are more overweight and obese men in every state than there are overweight and obese women. The numbers not only travel across state lines but also across ethnicities; only Asian and Pacific Islander men have overweight numbers below 50 percent&#x2014;and even then, 42 percent of them are overweight or obese. Across the board, men are quite literally being weighed down by their weight, and they are paying the price of lost strength, stamina, and energy.<br><br>Even more concerning is where the excess fat tissue shows up on a man: the gut. And that&#x2019;s when a major genetic disadvantage emerges. The type of weight gain that men experience gives them the &#x201c;gut&#x201d; or beer belly, and earns them the nickname of &#x201c;Santa&#x201d; or &#x201c;Buddha&#x201d; or &#x201c;Big.&#x201d; This situation has contributed to what I refer to as the &#x201c;mid-waist crisis&#x201d; that millions of men are experiencing today. Worse than a mid-life crisis, the mid-waist crisis can attack your body from the inside and bring you down&#x2014;as deep as six feet under.<br><br>The Evolution: A Mid-Waist Crisis<br><br>In 2008, researchers came to a frightening conclusion after monitoring nearly 360,000 men and women for ten years: increased abdominal fat had doubled their risk of premature death. To those of us in the medical field, this study confirmed a theory that had been developing for decades. To the general public, it scientifically defined a new public health enemy: belly fat.<br><br>How Much Is Too Much?<br><br>More than total weight or body mass index (BMI), your waist circumference is the simplest and most efficient gauge of your metabolic and hormonal health. Here are three methods I suggest my patients use for measuring belly fat:<br><br>1.Take a tape measure and wrap it around your bare-skin abdominal region right at your belly button. Suck in and check the number. What is it? Anything over 40 inches is too much. For a woman, 35 inches or less is the goal.<br><br>2.Stand naked in front of a full-length mirror. Turn sideways and look at yourself in the mirror. For men, which is farther out&#x2014;your stomach or your penis? If it&#x2019;s your stomach, it&#x2019;s too big.<br><br>3.Still naked and standing, tilt your head back and look at the ceiling. Now, bring your head forward and put your chin on your chest. See anything below your belly? You should. If you don&#x2019;t, there&#x2019;s a problem. (In other words, #cycyp&#x2014;can you see your penis?)<br><br>Belly fat, also known as intra-abdominal fat and scientifically referred to as visceral fat, is more than just an unattractive gathering of fat cells covering your abs. It is an insidious, metabolically active type of fat that deposits inside and around your organs. It&#x2019;s more than just unappealing to the eye&#x2014;it can be deadly. Once entrenched there, visceral fat spews out hormones and toxins that disrupt your natural biological functions.<br><br>While its first course of action may be to ding your self-confidence, visceral fat goes on to do much greater damage inside your body. Admit it: when your stomach has prevented you from giving a full embrace to an attractive individual, you may have sucked in your gut or hugged the air, Hollywood style.<br><br>This type of fat has also been linked to an ever-growing list of metabolic disturbances and diseases, including diabetes, endothelial dysfunction (a rusting on the inside of your arteries and a precursor to heart disease), erectile dysfunction, heart disease, high cholesterol, hypertension, insulin resistance, and colon cancer. As one researcher claimed, &#x201c;Visceral obesity does seem to be truly evil.&#x201d;<br><br>Men gain this dangerous type of fat first, whereas women are more inclined to gain subcutaneous fat tissue&#x2014;the squishy, pinchable type of fat. Visceral fat is dense and firm to the touch. No, that&#x2019;s not muscle pushing your stomach out beyond your pants; it&#x2019;s packed-in visceral fat.<br><br>Man Memo<br><br>Women can gain up to 44 more pounds of body fat than men, on average, before they experience the same severity of risk factors.<br><br>The Journal of Clinical Investigation published a study evaluating each gender&#x2019;s metabolic risk profile at the same level of body fat. Men had higher total cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood sugar than did women, and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)&#x2014;what&#x2019;s considered to be the &#x201c;good&#x201d; or &#x201c;healthy&#x201d; cholesterol. Talk about being set up for failure. But wait, the plot&#x2014;not just your blood&#x2014;thickens.<br><br>When the researchers sat these men and women down for a meal and then measured their metabolic responses, men continued to be worse off: they showed higher levels of triglycerides and lagged behind in ability to clear out the triglycerides quickly. Triglycerides are a form of troublemaker fat in your blood&#x2014;like teenagers drinking beer in front of your house, you don&#x2019;t want them loitering around. Chronically elevated triglycerides have been linked to coronary artery disease, a condition significantly more prevalent in men, and to small, beady, dense LDL cholesterol.<br><br>Visceral fat was to blame for these stubborn triglycerides, and labeled the &#x201c;best predictor&#x201d; of the delayed ability to clear out fats from the blood. The study left little room for doubt: men have more visceral fat and it doesn&#x2019;t just sit idly by. It gets involved, and not with good intentions.<br><br>Visceral fat likes to nestle itself around several important organs and settle close to the portal vein, which drains from the small intestine into the liver. What researchers have found is that visceral fat will dump inflammatory proteins and hormones into the portal vein, sending them directly down to the liver. That is, visceral fat is your polluting neighbor who dumps paint thinner and motor oil on the ground . . . to leach into your water supply.</p><h2>Bohemian Grove: Cult of Conspiracy</h2><p>They secretly meet for seventeen days each July at a place called the Bohemian Grove, a remote forest of ancient redwood trees in the deep Northern California woods.

On May 25, 1841, the Massachusetts whaleship Sharon set out for the whaling ground of the northwestern Pacific. A year later, while most of the crew was out hunting, Captain Howes Norris was brutally murdered. When the men in the whaleboats returned, they found four crew members on board, three of whom were covered in blood, the other screaming from atop the mast. Single-handedly, the third officer launched a surprise attack to recapture the Sharon, killing two of the attackers and subduing the other. An American investigation into the murder was never conducted--even when the Sharon returned home three years later, with only four of the original twenty-nine crew on board. Joan Druett, a historian who&#39;s been called a female Patrick O&#39;Brian by the Wall Street Journal, dramatically re-creates the mystery of the ill-fated whaleship and reveals a voyage filled with savagery under the command of one of the most ruthless captains to sail the high seas.</p><p><b>Joan Druett</b>&nbsp;is a maritime historian and the award-winning author of several books, including&nbsp;<i>Petticoat Whalers</i>,&nbsp;<i>She Was a Sister Sailor</i>,&nbsp;<i>Hen Frigates</i>,&nbsp;<i>Tupaia</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Discovery of Tahiti.&nbsp;</i>Her interest in maritime history began in 1984, when she discovered the grave of a young American whaling wife while exploring the tropical island of Rarotonga; she subsequently received a Fulbright fellowship to study whaling wives in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and California. Her ground-breaking work in the field of seafaring women was also recognized with a L. Byrne Waterman Award. She is married to Ron Druett, a maritime artist.A small notice in a Sydney shipping publication in 1842 hinted of a bigger story: A Massachusetts-based whaling ship, the SHARON, was putting into port due to desertions and the murder of its captain. Parts of the story were publicized at the time, but other pieces remained secret for years. Joan Druett decided to take a closer look at events that may have inspired Herman Melville's TYPEE and MOBY-DICK. She investigated the journals and personal logs written at the time to find the characters and motives behind the unusual events. Dennis Boutsikaris goes beyond a dry, factual reading to create a gripping drama of cruelty on the seas, as suspenseful as any of Melville's fiction.

But a dark plot is about to unfold involving a reclusive toymaker who lives in a gigantic mansion filled with mechanical beings and shadows of the past.<br><br>As strange lights shine through the fog surrounding a small, barren island, Irene's younger brother dreams of a dark creature hidden deep in the forest. And when a young girl is found murdered, her body at the end of a path torn through the woods by a monstrous, inhuman force, Irene and Ishmael wonder--has a demonic presence been unleashed on the inhabitants of Cape House? Together, they'll have to survive the most terrifying summer of their lives.</p><p><b>Carlos Ruiz Zaf�n</b> is the author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Prince of Mist </i>and the international phenomena<i> The Shadow of the Wind </i>and <i>The Angel's Game</i>. His work has been published<i> </i>in more than fifty countries and honored with numerous awards. He<i> </i>divides his time between Barcelona, Spain, and Los Angeles, California.First published in Spain in 1995, this early work from Zaf�n hits all the gothic horror bases: creepy castles, foreboding caves, haunted lighthouses, murky woods, masked balls, and just about everything else you might hope for. Mostly, though, this is a cunning twist on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&#x2014;with a little bit of ventriloquist-dummy horror thrown in for good measure. Fourteen-year-old Irene&#x2019;s penniless mother has just won the jackpot: she&#x2019;s been hired to keep house at Cravenmoore, the estate of reclusive toymaker Lazarus Jann. He&#x2019;s a kindly eccentric, but the grinning automatons populating his castle carry an air of menace. Just as frightening is the personless shadow giving chase to Irene and her little brother. And what of the legend of the woman who drowned in the lagoon? Though there is probably one mystery too many here, Zaf�n cuts between his various characters with cinematic skill, and his habit of telling stories within the narrative is put to spine-tingling use, just as it was with The Midnight Palace (2011). Good, solid scares. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Zaf�n is still cruising off the might of the international best-sellers The Shadow of the Wind (2004) and The Angel&#x2019;s Game (2009). Anything he does for quite a while will garner a good deal of interest.

In this unprecedented comparison of the three most recent meetings, John O&#x2019;Malley traverses more than 450 years of Catholic history and examines the councils&#x2019; most pressing and consistent concerns: questions of purpose, power, and relevance in a changing world. By offering new, sometimes radical, even troubling perspectives on these convocations, <i>When Bishops Meet</i> analyzes the evolution of the church itself.</p><p>The Catholic Church today is shaped by the historical arc starting from Trent in the sixteenth century to Vatican II. The roles of popes, the laity, theologians, and others have varied from the bishop-centered Trent, to Vatican I&#x2019;s declaration of papal infallibility, to a new balance of power in the mid-twentieth century. At Trent, lay people had direct influence on proceedings. By Vatican II, their presence was token. At each gathering, fundamental issues recurred: the relationship between bishops and the papacy, the very purpose of a council, and doctrinal change. Can the teachings of the church, by definition a conservative institution, change over time?</p><p>Councils, being ecclesiastical as well as cultural institutions, have always reflected and profoundly influenced their times. Readers familiar with John O&#x2019;Malley&#x2019;s earlier work as well as those with no knowledge of councils will find this volume an indispensable guide for essential questions: Who is in charge of the church? What difference did the councils make, and will there be another?</p></p><p>John W. O&#x2019;Malley is University Professor in the Department of Theology at Georgetown University and the author of many books, including <i>Four Cultures of the West</i>, <i>Trent</i>, <i>Vatican I</i>, <i>What Happened at Vatican II</i>, and <i>The First Jesuits</i> (all from Harvard); <i>The First Jesuits</i> has been translated into twelve languages. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and a recipient of the Harvard Centennial Medal as well as Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Society for Italian Historical Studies, the Renaissance Society of America, and the American Catholic Historical Association. O&#x2019;Malley is a member of the Society of Jesus and a Roman Catholic priest.&#x201c;This magnificent study shows how the Catholic Church has tried to reconcile faithfulness to its core identity throughout the ages. Drawing on his deeply researched studies of councils, O&#x2019;Malley illuminates how the Church has moved from Trent&#x2019;s definitions of what was permitted and forbidden to Vatican II&#x2019;s attempt to articulate the Church&#x2019;s identity in the modern world&#x2015;a plea for reconciliation between humans of all faiths and convictions.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Charles Taylor, McGill University</b><br><br>&#x201c;A master historian shows how the churches&#x2019; councils encapsulate the history of Catholicism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anthony Grafton, Princeton University</b><br><br>&#x201c;In John O&#x2019;Malley&#x2019;s <i>When Bishops Meet</i>&#x2015;the latest of his five books on ecumenical church councils&#x2015;he compares and contrasts what he has written on the three last councils and argues that there should be a new one.

Told to try yoga by everyone from the woman behind the counter at the co-op to the homeless guy on the corner, she signed up for her first class. She fell madly in love.</p><p>Over the next decade, she would tackle triangle, wheel, and the dreaded crow, becoming fast friends with some poses and developing long-standing feuds with others. At the same time, she found herself confronting the forces that shaped her generation. Daughters of women who ran away to find themselves and made a few messes along the way, Dederer and her peers grew up determined to be good, good, good&#x2015;even if this meant feeling hemmed in by the smugness of their organic-buying, attachment-parenting, anxiously conscientious little world. Yoga seemed to fit right into this virtuous program, but to her surprise, Dederer found that the deeper she went into the poses, the more they tested her most basic ideas of what makes a good mother, daughter, friend, wife&#x2015;and the more they made her want something a little less tidy, a little more improvisational. Less goodness, more joy.</p><p><i>Poser </i>is unlike any other book about yoga you will read&#x2015;because it is actually a book about life. Witty and heartfelt, sharp and irreverent, <i>Poser </i>is for anyone who has ever tried to stand on their head while keeping both feet on the ground.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, January 2011</strong>: Yoga, even as it furthers its storefront-by-storefront takeover of American leisure hours, remains a punchline, a shorthand summing-up of a certain way of life. One of the charms of <em>Poser</em>, Claire Dederer's memoir of motherhood and marriage structured around her love affair with yoga, is that--as her title hints--she gets the joke, and tells it very well herself. She knows, to the molecule, the subculture she swims within--the "liberal enclave" of late '90s North Seattle, with its self-policed, guilt-laced dictates about the proper ways to parent, work, play, and wed (and divorce)--and she's well aware of every knee-jerk response you might bring to a story about yoga (she had them too). She's sharp and funny, shifting expertly between earthy put-downs and the earnest openness that yoga leads her to. And she's wisest, and most fascinating, when she's plotting the differences between her mother's generation, breaking out from the traditions of young marriage and motherhood in sloppy, self-invented ways, and her own, responding to the chaos of their parents' marriages and their own youth with the anxiously seamless embrace of attachment parenting. Readers will inevitably be reminded of another witty, navel-gazing, West-meets-East memoir, <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em>, but Dederer's more domestic journey is her very much her own. <em>--Tom Nissley</em><br><p><b>Claire Dederer's</b> essays, criticism, and reporting have appeared in <i>Vogue, The New York Times, Slate, Salon, Yoga Journal, Real Simple, The Nation</i> and in newspapers around the country.

The edges of its terraces had crumbled in landslides of bitumen and baked brick; storks nested on its ragged top, which had once held the god's golden bedchamber and his sacred concubine in his golden bed. But this was only defacement; the ziggurat's huge bulk had defied destruction. The walls of the inner city by the Marduk Gate were three hundred feet high, but the ziggurat still towered over them.<br><br>Near by was the god's temple; this Xerxes' men had succeeded in half demolishing. The rest of the roof was patched with thatch, and propped on shafts of rough-hewn timber. At the inner end, where the columns were faced with splendid but chipped enamels, there was still a venerable gloom, a smell of incense and burnt offerings. On an altar of porphyry, under a smoke-duct open to the sky, burned in its bronze basket the sacred fire. It was low; the fuel-box was empty. Its shaven acolyte looked from it to the priest. Abstracted though he was, it caught his eye.<br><br>"Fetch fuel. What are you about? Must a king die when it serves your laziness? Move! You were got when your mother was asleep and snoring."<br><br>The acolyte made a sketchy obeisance; the temple discipline was not strict.<br><br>The priest said, after him, "It will not be yet. Maybe not even today. He is tough as a mountain lion, he will die hard."<br><br>Two tall shadows fell at the temple's open end. The priests who entered wore the high felt miters of Chaldeans. They approached the altar with ritual gestures, bowing with hand on mouth.<br><br>The priest of Marduk said, "Nothing yet?"<br><br>"No," said the first Chaldean. "But it will be soon. He cannot speak; indeed he can scarcely breathe. But when his homeland soldiers made a clamor at the doors, demanding to see him, he had them all admitted.

That finished him, and now he is in the death-sleep."<br><br>A door behind the altar opened to let in two Marduk priests. It gave a glimpse of a rich interior; embroidered hangings, a gleam of gold. There was a smell of spiced meats cooking. The door closed on it.<br><br>The Chaldeans, reminded of an old scandal, exchanged glances. One of them said, "We did our best to turn him from the city. But he had heard that the temple had not been restored; and he thought we were afraid of him."<br><br>A Marduk priest said stiffly, "The year has not been auspicious for great works. Nebuchadrezzar built in an inauspicious year. His foreign slaves rioted race against race, and threw each other off the tower. As for Sikandar, he would still be fortunate, sitting safe in Susa, if he had not defied the god."<br><br>One of the Chaldeans said, "It seems to me he did well enough by the god, for all that he called him Herakles." He looked round, pointedly, at the half-ruined building. He might as well have said aloud, "Where is the gold the King gave you to rebuild, have you eaten and drunk it all?"<br><br>There was a hostile silence. The chief of the Marduk priests said, with emollient dignity, "Certainly you gave him a true prediction. And since then have you read the heavens?"<br><br>The tall miters bent together in slow assent. The oldest Chaldean, whose beard was silver against his dark face and purple robe, signed to the Marduk priest, beckoning him to the broken end of the temple. "This," he said, "is what is foretold for Babylon." He swept round his gold-starred wand, taking in the crumbling walls, the threadbare roof, the leaning timber-props, the fire-stained paving. "This for a while, and then . . . Babylon was."<br><br>He walked towards the entry and stood to listen; but the night noises were unchanged. "The heavens say it begins with the death of the King."<br><br>The priest remembered the shining youth who, eight years before, had come offering treasure and Arabian incense; and the man who had returned this year, weathered and scarred, the red-gold hair sun-bleached and streaked with white; but with the deep eyes still burning, still ready with the careless, reflex charm of the youth beloved, still terrible in anger. The scent of the incense had lasted long on the air, the gold much longer in the treasury; even among men who liked good living, half was in the strongroom still. But for the priest of Bel-Marduk the pleasure had drained out of it. It spoke now of flames and blood. His spirit sank like the altar fire when the fuel was low.<br><br>"Shall we see it? Will a new Xerxes come?"<br><br>The Chaldean shook his head. "A dying, not a killing. Another city will rise and ours will wane. It is under the sign of the King."<br><br>"What? Will he live, then, after all?"<br><br>"He is dying, as I told you. But his sign is walking along the constellations, further than we can reckon in years. You will not see it setting in your day."<br><br>"So? Well, in his life he did us no harm. Maybe he will spare us dead."<br><br>The astrologer frowned to himself, like an adult seeking words to reach a child. "Remember, last year, the fire that fell from heaven. We heard where it fell, and went there, a week's journey. It had lit the city brighter than full moon. But we found, where it had struck, it had broken into red-hot embers, which had charred the earth around them. One had been set up by a farmer in his house, because that day his wife bore twin sons. But a neighbor had stolen it for its power; they fought, and both men died. Another piece fell at a dumb child's feet, and speech came back to him. A third had kindled a fire that destroyed a forest. But the Magus of the place had taken the greatest piece, and built it into the fire-altar, because of its great light while it was in the sky. And all this from the one star. So it will be."<br><br>The priest bowed his head. A fragrance drifted to him from the precinct's kitchen. Better to invite the Chaldeans than let the meat spoil with waiting. Whatever the stars said, good food was good food.<br><br>The old Chaldean said, looking into the shadows, "Here where we stand, the leopard will rear her young.<br><br>The priest made a decent pause. No sound from the royal palace. With luck, they might get something to eat before they heard the wailing.<br><br>The walls of Nebuchadrezzar's palace were four feet thick, and faced with blue-glazed tiles for coolness; but the midsummer heat seeped in through everything. The sweat running down Eumenes' wrist blotted the ink on his papyrus. The wax glistened moistly on the tablet he was fair-copying; he plunged it back into the cold-water tub where his clerk had left it, with the other drafts, to keep the surface set. Local scribes used wet clay; but that would have set hard before one could revise on it. For the third time he went to the doorway, seeking a slave to pull the punkah cord. Once again the dim hushed noises--soft feet, soft voices furtive or awed or grieving--sent him back behind the drawn door-curtain to his listless task. To clap the hands, to call, to shout an order, were all unthinkable.<br><br>He had not sought his clerk, a garrulous man; but he could have done with the silent slave and the waft of the punkah. He scanned the unfinished scroll pinned to his writing-board. It was twenty years since he had written with his own hand any letter not of high secrecy; why now was he writing one that would never go, short of a miracle? There had been many miracles; but, surely, not now. It was something to do, it shut out the unknown future. Sitting down again he retrieved the tablet, propped it, dried his hand on the towel the clerk had left, and picked up his pen.<br><br>And the ships commanded by Niarchos will muster at the river-mouth, where I shall review them while Perdikkas is bringing the army down from Babylon; and sacrifices will be made there to the appropriate gods. I shall then take command of the land force and begin the march to the west. The first stage . . .<br><br>When he was five, before he'd been taught to write, he came to me in the King's business room. "What's that, Eumenes?" "A letter." "What's the first word that you've written big?" "Your father's name. PHILIP, King of the Macedonians. Now I'm busy, run back to your play." "Make me my name. Do, dear Eumenes. Please." I gave it him written, on the back of a spoiled despatch. Next day he'd learned it, and carved it all over the wax for a royal letter to Kersobleptes of Thrace. He had my ruler across his palm . . .<br><br>Because of the heat he had left open his massive door. A brisk stride, half hushed like all other sounds, approached it. Ptolemy pushed aside the curtain and drew it to behind him. His craggy war-weathered face was creased with fatigue; he had been up all night, without the stimulus of action. He was forty-three, and looked older. Eumenes waited, wordlessly.<br><br>"He has given his ring to Perdikkas," Ptolemy said.<br><br>There was a pause. Eumenes' alert Greek face--not a bookish one, he had had his share of soldiering--searched the impassive Macedonian's. "For what? As deputy? Or as Regent?"<br><br>"Since he could not speak," said Ptolemy drily, "we shall never know."<br><br>"If he has accepted death," Eumenes reasoned, "we may presume the second. If not . . . ?<br><br>"It's all one, now. He neither sees nor hears. He is in the death-sleep."<br><br>"Do not be sure. I have heard of men who were thought already dead, and who said later that they heard everything."<br><br>Ptolemy suppressed an impatient gesture. These wordy Greeks. Or what is he afraid of? "I came because you and I have known him since he was born. Don't you want to be there?"<br><br>"Do the Macedonians want me there?" An ancient bitterness pinched, for a moment, Eumenes' mouth.<br><br>"Oh, come. Everyone trusts you. We shall need you before long."<br><br>Slowly the Secretary began to put his desk in order. He said, wiping his pen, "And nothing, to the last, about an heir?"<br><br>"Perdikkas asked him, while he could still get a whisper out. He only said, 'To the best man. Hoti to kratisto.' "<br><br>Eumenes thought, They say dying men can prophesy. He shivered.<br><br>"Or," Ptolemy added, "so Perdikkas told us. He was leaning over. Nobody else could hear."<br><br>Eumenes put down the pen and looked up sharply. "Or Kratero? You say he whispered, he was short of breath." They looked at one another. Krateros, the highest-ranking of all Alexander's staff, was on the march to Macedon, to take over the regency from Antipatros. "If he'd been in the room . . . "<br><br>Ptolemy shrugged. "Who knows?" To himself he thought, If Hephaistion had been there . . . But if he'd lived, none of this would have happened. He'd have done none of the crazy things he's dying of. Coming to Babylon in midsummer--boating about in the filthy swamps down river . . . But one did not discuss Hephaistion with Eumenes. "This door weighs like an elephant. Do you want it shut?"<br><br>Pausing on the threshold, Eumenes said, "Nothing about Roxane and the child? Nothing?"<br><br>"Four months to go. And what if it's a girl?"<br><br>They moved into the shadowy corridor, tall big-boned Macedonian and slender Greek. A young Macedonian officer came blundering towards them, almost ran into Ptolemy, and stammered an apology. Ptolemy said, "Is there any change?"<br><br>"No, sir, I don't think so." He swallowed violently; they saw that he was crying.<br><br>When he had gone, Ptolemy said, "That boy believes in it. I can't yet."<br><br>"Well, let us go."<br><br>"Wait." Ptolemy took his arm, led him back into the room, and dragged-to the great ebony door on its groaning hinges. "I'd best tell you this while we've time. You should have known before, but . . ."<br><br>"Yes, yes?" said Eumenes impatiently. He had quarreled with Hephaistion shortly before he died, and Alexander had never been easy with him since.<br><br>Ptolemy said, "Stateira is pregnant, too."<br><br>Eumenes, who had been fidgeting to be gone, was struck into stillness. "You mean Darius' daughter?"<br><br>"Who else do you suppose? She is Alexander's wife."<br><br>"But this changes everything. When did . . . ?"<br><br>"Don't you remember? No, of course, you'd gone on to Babylon. When he came to himself after Hephaistion died" (one could not avoid the name forever) "he went to war with the Kossaians. My doing; I told him they'd demanded road-toll, and got him angry. He needed to be doing something. It did him good. When he'd dealt with them, and was heading here, he stopped a week at Susa, to call upon Sisygambis."<br><br>"That old witch," said Eumenes bitterly. But for her, he thought, the King's friends would never have been saddled with Persian wives. The mass wedding at Susa had gone by like some drama of superhuman magnificence, till suddenly he had found himself alone in a scented pavilion, in bed with a Persian noblewoman whose unguents repelled him, and whose only Greek consisted of "Greeting, my lord."<br><br>"A great lady," said Ptolemy. "A pity his mother was not like her. She would have had him married before he set out from Macedon, and seen that he got a son. He could have had an heir of fourteen by this time. She'd not have sickened him with marriage while he was a child. Whose fault was it that he wasn't ready for a woman till he met the Bactrian?" Thus, unofficially, did most Macedonians refer to Roxane.<br><br>"Done is done. But Stateira . . . Does Perdikkas know?"<br><br> "That's why he asked him to name his heir."<br><br>"And still he would not?"<br><br>" 'To the best,' he said. He left it to us, to the Macedonians, to choose when they came of age. Yes, he's a Macedonian at the last."<br><br>"If they are boys," Eumenes reminded him.<br><br>Ptolemy, who had been withdrawn into his thought, said, "And if they come of age."<br><br>Eumenes said nothing. They went down the dim corridor with its blue-tiled walls towards the death-chamber.</p><h2>Welcome to Who-ville (Illumination&#39;s The Grinch) (Step into Reading)</h2><p><b>Grow your heart three sizes with <i>Illumination presents Dr. Seuss' The Grinch</i>--the new Grinch movie in theaters November 9, 2018!</b><br><br>From Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures, <i>Illumination presents Dr. Seuss' The Grinch</i>, a new animated movie, is based on the Dr. Seuss classic about a grumpy Grinch who tries to steal Christmas!

Rather than measuring the worth of the West through its cultural or literary accomplishments, Hanson engages with the much starker record of its successes in combat against non-Western armies. In place of the &#34;Great Books&#34;, he studies the &#34;Great Battles&#34; and augments his bold thesis with some evocations of the intensity of warfare.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson was born in 1953 and received his PhD from Stanford University. He is currently Professor of Classics at California State University, Fresno. His popular books on classical warfare include The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece, The Soul of Battle: From Ancient Times to the Present Day, How Three Great Liberators Vanquished Tyranny, The Other Greeks: The Family Farm and the Agrarian Roots of Western Civilization and Fields Without Dreams: Defending Agrarian Idea. He lives in Selma, California.&#39;Western countries have tended to defeat their enemies in warfare over the last 2500 years as a result of a sustained cultural heritage that has made them ruthlessly efficient on the battlefield.

One did not gloat, or cheer, or weep, or rage, although cold fury was, upon occasion, deemed an appropriate reaction to particular circumstances.<br><br>Senior Lieutenant Iden Versio had been familiar with this stipulation since she was old enough to understand the concept. Even so, now, at this hour of the Empire&#x2019;s unequivocal and absolute triumph, the young woman raced across the gleaming black surface of the Death Star&#x2019;s corridors with her helmet cradled in one arm, trying and failing to smother a grin.<br><br>Today, of all days, why shouldn&#x2019;t she smile, at least when no one was watching?<br><br>When her orders had come to serve on the space station&#x2014;�which a scant few hours ago had reduced an entire planet into rocky chunks of glorious rebel rubble&#x2014; �Iden had endured resentful, sidelong glances followed by murmurs pitched exactly too softly for her to catch. But Iden didn&#x2019;t need to hear the words. She knew what the others were saying about her. It was nothing more than a variant on what had always been said about her.<br><br>She&#x2019;s too young for this position. She couldn&#x2019;t have earned it on her own.<br><br>She got it because of her father.<br><br>The self-�righteous mutterers would have been startled to discover the degree to which their assumptions were wrong.<br><br>Inspector General Garrick Versio might well be one of the highest-�ranking members of the powerful and secretive Imperial Security Bureau, but Iden had gotten nothing out of the joyless task of being his daughter. Every honor, every grade, every opportunity she&#x2019;d had, she&#x2019;d fought for and obtained despite him.<br><br>She&#x2019;d been primed for the military academy while barely more than a child, studying at the Future Imperial Leaders Military Preparatory School on her homeworld of Vardos, located in the Jinata system, where she had, literally, been bloodied. There, and afterward at the Imperial Academy on Coruscant, Iden had graduated top of her class, with honors.<br><br>All that felt like a mere prelude to this moment. For the last several months, Iden had been part of a small, elite TIE fighter unit aboard what was arguably the pinnacle of Imperial design&#x2014;�the massive space station known as the Death Star. And she was rather unprofessionally excited.<br><br>Even as she tried to rein in her enthusiasm, she could sense that others hastening to their own TIE fighters shared it. They betrayed themselves with the surging tattoo of booted footfalls, their upright positions, even the brightness in their eyes.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t new, this happy tension. Iden had seen it bubbling under the surface after the first test of the station&#x2019;s capabilities, when the Death Star&#x2019;s superlaser had targeted and obliterated Jedha City. The Empire had landed a one-two punch in a handful of seconds. It had destroyed not only the rebel terrorist Saw Gerrera and his group of extremists known as the partisans, but also the ancient Temple of the Kyber, held sacred by those who secretly hoped for the return of the disgraced and defeated Jedi. Jedha City represented the first real demonstration of the station&#x2019;s power, but that fact was known only to those who served on the Death Star.<br><br>For now. To the rest of the galaxy, what had happened at Jedha was a tragic mining accident.<br><br>Things had happened with shocking speed after that, as if some galactic balance had suddenly, drastically, been tipped. The super�laser was again employed at the Battle of Scarif, this time wiping out an entire region and several rebel ships trapped under Scarif&#x2019;s shield along with it. Emperor Palpatine had dissolved the Imperial Senate. His right hand, the mysterious caped and helmeted Darth Vader, had intercepted and imprisoned secret rebel and now former senator Princess Leia Organa. The Death Star&#x2019;s director, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, had used the princess&#x2019;s home planet of Alderaan to demonstrate the true breadth of the power of the now fully operational battle station.<br><br>As nearly all on the Death Star had been ordered to do, with their own eyes or on a screen, Iden had stood and watched. By their treasonous actions, the rebels on Alderaan had brought destruction not only on themselves, but on the innocents they always seemed so keen to protect. She couldn&#x2019;t get the image out of her head: a planet, a world, gone in the span of a few seconds. As, soon, would be virtually all the Empire&#x2019;s enemies. In a very, very short time, the galaxy would receive an implacable and thorough understanding of just how useless resistance would be. And then&#x2014;�<br><br>Then, there would be order, and this ill-�thought-�out, chaotic &#x201c;Rebellion&#x201d; would subside. All the extensive hours of labor, all the credits and brainpower spent on controlling and dominating various unruly worlds could, at last, be turned to helping them.<br><br>There would, finally, be peace.<br><br>The event would be shocking, yes. But it had to be, and it was all for the greater good. Once everyone was under the auspices of the Empire, they would understand.<br><br>And that glorious moment was almost here. Tarkin had located the rebel base on one of Yavin&#x2019;s moons. The base&#x2014;�and the moon&#x2014;�were but a few moments from oblivion.<br><br>Some of the rebels, though, were not going to go �quietly.<br><br>These few had taken to space and were presently mounting a humorously feeble attack on the gigantic space station. The thirty Y-� and X-�wing fighters the rebels had mustered were small enough to dodge the station&#x2019;s defensive turbolaser turrets, zipping about like flies. And, like flies, this nominal, futile defense would be casually swatted down by Iden and the other pilots in ship-�to-�ship combat, as per orders from Lord Vader.<br><br>Within the span of seven minutes, Yavin&#x2019;s moon and all the rebels it had succored would be nothing more than floating debris. On this day, the Rebellion would be no more.<br><br>Iden&#x2019;s heartbeat thudded in her ears as she all but jumped down the ladder into her fighter, sealing her flight suit and pulling on her helmet. Slender but strong gloved fingers flew over the consoles, her gaze flitting over the stats as she went through the preflight checklist. The hatch lowered, hummed shut, and she was encased in its black metal belly. A few seconds later she was swirling in cold, airless darkness, where the distinctive scream of her vessel was silent.<br><br>Here they came, now, mostly the �X-�wings&#x2014;�the Rebellion&#x2019;s answer to TIE fighters. They were impressive little single-�occupant vessels, and they skimmed along close to the surface of the station, a few of them misjudging the distance and slamming into the walls around the trenches that crisscrossed the Death Star&#x2019;s surface.<br><br>Suicide, Iden thought, even as she knew the term was just as often applied to those who flew TIE fighters. You either loved the small starfighters or you hated them. A TIE fighter was fast and distinctive, with its laser cannons quite deadly, but it was more vulnerable to attack than other vessels as it wasn&#x2019;t equipped with deflector shields. The trick was to kill the enemy first&#x2014;�something Iden was better at than anyone else in her squadron. Iden liked that everything was compact and immediately to hand&#x2014;�flight controls, viewscreen, targeting systems, equipment for tracking and being tracked.<br><br>Iden listened to the familiar beeps of the tracking equipment as it targeted and locked onto one of the �X-�wings. She swung her vessel back and forth with easy familiarity as the enemy ship frantically jigged and jagged in a commendable, but ultimately useless, effort to evade her.<br><br>She pressed her thumbs down. Green lasers sliced through the X-wing, and then only pieces and a flaring sheet of flame remained.<br><br>A quick count on her screen told Iden that her fellow pilots were also efficiently culling the herd of rebels. She frowned slightly at the tiny, ship-�shaped blips on her screen. Some of them were veering off from the group, going deeper in toward the Death Star, while others seemed to be trying to draw the TIE fighters away from the station. Iden&#x2019;s gaze flickered to another ship, a �Y-�wing&#x2014;�one of those enemy vessels that always looked to her like a skeletal bird of prey&#x2014;�and she went in pursuit, rolling smoothly and coming up on its side. More streaks of green in the star-�spattered blackness, and then it, too, was gone.<br><br>Her gaze now lingered on the more suicidal of the enemy fighters, watching as they dropped into the trenches. As far as Iden knew, no one in her six-�pilot squadron had been told why the rebels had �adopted this peculiar tactic of flying through the trenches. Iden had grown up with nearly everything&#x2014;�from what it was her father actually did for the Empire to what her mother was designing that day, even what was for dinner that night&#x2014;�being on a need-�to-�know basis. She had grown accustomed to the situation, but she would never like&nbsp;it.<br><br>&#x201c;Attention, pilots,&#x201d; came the voice of her commander, Kela Neerik, in Iden&#x2019;s ear, and for a brief, beautiful instant Iden thought her squad commander was going to explain what was going on. But all Neerik said was, &#x201c;Death Star is now six minutes out from target.&#x201d;<br><br>Iden bit her lip, wondering if she should speak up. Don&#x2019;t. Don&#x2019;t, she told herself, but the words had a life of their own. Before she realized it, out they had come.<br><br>&#x201c;Respectfully, Commander, with only six minutes until the entire moon&#x2019;s destruction, why are we out here? Surely thirty one-�person ships won&#x2019;t be able to do anything resembling damage to the Death Star in that amount of time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lieutenant Versio&#x201d;&#x2014;�Neerik&#x2019;s voice was as cold as space&#x2014;�&#x201c;don&#x2019;t assume your father&#x2019;s position gives you special privileges. We are here because Lord Vader ordered us to be here. Perhaps you&#x2019;d like to put your question to him personally when we return to the station? I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;d be delighted to explain his military strategy to you.&#x201d;<br><br>Iden felt a cold knot in her stomach at the thought of a &#x201c;personal&#x201d; conversation with Lord Vader. She&#x2019;d never met him, thankfully, but she had heard too many chilling rumors.<br><br>&#x201c;No, Commander, that won&#x2019;t be necessary.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought not. Do your duty, Lieutenant Versio.&#x201d;<br><br>Iden frowned, then let it go. She did not need to understand the rebels; she needed only to destroy them.<br><br>As if they sensed her renewed resolve, the rebel pilots suddenly upped their game. There was a brief flash at the corner of Iden&#x2019;s vision, and when she turned to look, she realized with sick surprise that the debris hurtling off in all directions was black.<br><br>Iden didn&#x2019;t know who had just died. TIE fighters were so uniform as to be practically indistinguishable from one another. Their pilots weren&#x2019;t supposed to think of their ships in the warm, fuzzy way the rebels were reported to do. A ship was a ship was a ship. And Iden understood that, as far as most in the Empire were concerned, a pilot was a pilot was a pilot: as expendable and interchangeable as the ships they flew.<br><br>We all serve at the pleasure of the Emperor, her father had drilled into her since she was old enough to comprehend what an emperor was. None of us is indispensable. Iden had certainly seen Imperial ships shot down before. This was war, and she was a soldier. But indispensable be damned.<br><br>The half smile she&#x2019;d been wearing during most of the combat vanished, and Iden pressed her lips together angrily. She veered, perhaps a touch too violently, to the right and targeted another �X-�wing. In mere seconds it exploded into a yellow-�orange fireball.<br><br>&#x201c;Gotcha, you&#x2014;�&#x201d; she muttered.<br><br>&#x201c;No commentary, Versio,&#x201d; warned Neerik, her voice rising a little; more hot than cold, now. &#x201c;We will be having the honor of Lord Vader joining us momentarily. He and his pilots will be focusing on the hostiles navigating the meridian trench. All remaining units are ordered to redirect their attacks to the rebel ships on the magnetic perimeter.&#x201d;<br><br>Iden almost shouted a protest, but stopped herself just in time. For some reason still unknown to the squadron, this perplexing tactic by the rebel pilots was clearly of great concern. Lord Vader wouldn&#x2019;t trouble himself with appearing personally to take care of it other�wise.<br><br>Almost everything Iden knew about Darth Vader was pure speculation. The exception was a single revelation on the part of her father, in one of those rare moments when he was feeling less taciturn than usual with his only child.<br><br>&#x201c;Lord Vader has great power,&#x201d; Versio had said. &#x201c;His instincts and his reflexes are uncanny. And . . . there are certain abilities he possesses that our Emperor finds to be of tremendous value.&#x201d;<br><br>So yes. Vader was head and shoulders above the rest of them&#x2014;�literally and figuratively. But it wasn&#x2019;t Vader&#x2019;s friends who were dying in this battle, and Iden burned to be the one to make the rebels pay.<br><br>With a huffing sigh that she was certain was audible, she swerved from tailing the X-�wing, frowning as red laser�fire came perilously close to her fighter&#x2019;s fragile wings. That was on her; she hadn&#x2019;t been focusing.<br><br>She corrected that oversight immediately, zooming away from the station toward a pair of Y-�wings that was, successfully, attempting to get her attention. Any other time, Iden would have enjoyed toying with them&#x2014;�they were decent pilots, although the ones in the X-wings were superior&#x2014;�but right now she was too irritated to do so.<br><br>She targeted the closest Y-�wing, locked onto it, and blew it to pieces. Watching the fragments of the star�fighter hurtling wildly was some small compensation for the deaths of her fellow pilots.<br><br>&#x201c;Death Star is two minutes to target. Be aware of your distance from the planet.&#x201d;<br><br>Ah, so that was why Neerik was giving the countdown. Iden had to give the pilot of the other �Y-�wing credit for courage, albeit of the foolish kind; the ship was now racing away from the Death Star at top speed. Were they heading back to Yavin&#x2019;s moon, nobly choosing to die with their base, or were they just trying to evade her?<br><br>Not happening, Iden thought, and continued her pursuit. She got the vessel in her sights and fired. She didn&#x2019;t slow as the ship exploded, but simply pulled back and looped up and over the fireball and debris, snug in her crash webbing, and smoothly dipped the TIE fighter in front of the second �Y-�wing for the perfect shot.<br><br>The pale moon-�shape of the Death Star loomed behind the vessel, its gargantuan size making the rebel ship look like the toys she&#x2019;d been allowed to play with as a child. The �Y-�wing was making for Yavin as fast as it could, swerving erratically enough that Iden frowned as she tried to get a lock on it.<br><br>A sudden scalding brightness filled her vision.<br><br>Temporarily blinded, Iden hurtled wildly, her TIE fighter tumbling out of control. As her vision returned, she realized debris was coming at her as intensely as if she had suddenly materialized inside an asteroid field. Her focus, always powerful, narrowed to laserlike precision as she frantically dodged and swerved, maneuvering around the biggest pieces and wishing with all her being that TIE fighters had shields.<br><br>Iden pivoted and tumbled, breathing the mercifully still-...</p><h2>Doris Duke&#39;s Shangri-La: A House in Paradise: Architecture, Landscape, and Islamic Art</h2><p>This inspiring book accompanies the first traveling exhibition about Doris Duke&#x2019;s estate Shangri La and its influential synthesis of modernist architecture and Islamic art and design.

She tossed back her hair, which fell in golden waves across her shoulders, then put an index finger to her lips, as though to nervously bite her nail. Oh, yes, he liked the shy schoolgirl routine, and Valentina could pass for a freshman, too, though she was nearly twenty-eight.</p><p>"Hi, there. You must be Ms. Haspel," he said, drawing in his sagging gut and probably wishing his thinning hair were two shades darker. </p><p>She reached across the desk and accepted his hairy paw. "It's nice to meet you, Mr. Leonard, and thanks for the interview." </p><p>"Well, as I said, we only have one position to fill, so the competition is fierce. Please have a seat." </p><p>She settled down and leaned toward his desk, keeping her blue eyes locked on his. "Can I ask a question before we start?" </p><p>"By all means." </p><p>"Does the company have a sexual-harassment policy?" </p><p>His lip twitched. "Of course." </p><p>"Well, I've had some problems in the past." </p><p>"I'm sorry to hear that." </p><p>"Yeah, the one guy was married and claimed I was a stalker, which was totally not the case. The other guy kept saying I was making lewd remarks. He even said I flashed my panties, and there's no way I did that." </p><p>He hesitated. "Are you serious?" </p><p>"Yes. I like to get dressed up for work. It doesn't mean I want to have sex with everyone I see." </p><p>He cleared his throat. "Of course not. But you should know that we have a dress code. Business casual." </p><p>Valentina nodded and gazed salaciously at him. "Is what I'm wearing okay?" </p><p>He swallowed before answering. </p><br><p>* * * </p><br><p>HANSEN was sitting in an SUV parked outside the four-story office building. The complex was comprised of ten equally nondescript buildings: the headquarters for a lengthy list of companies that were, according to an intel report, "assembling stacked layers of silver and nonconducting magnesium fluoride and cutting out nanoscale-sized fishnet patterns to form metamaterials." </p><p>Grim had explained that metamaterials held the key to developing cloaking devices to render objects invisible to humans. Leonard's company in particular was developing paint for military vehicles and fabric for military uniforms. This was all quite serious business, which was why Hansen could only shake his head as he listened to Maya and Leonard. What the hell was she doing? All she had to do was get hired. </p><p>Admittedly, she'd hated the tired old plan of playing dress up to ensure Leonard took the bait, so overplaying the role was her way of protesting. She wouldn't just be the attractive new hire; she was now the quirky sex addict who'd called way too much attention to herself. Hansen was a breath away from reporting her misconduct to Grim, but then he thought better of it and just sat there as Maya told Leonard she was always available for overtime and "after-hours" work. Hansen grimaced. </p><br><p>* * * </p><br><p>AT 10:05 A.M. Nathan Noboru parked his utility van at the curb outside William Leonard's seven-thousand-square-foot home. Sprawling front lawns, well-manicured grounds, and tree-lined brick-paved driveways unfurled to a grand entrance shadowed by twenty-foot columns painted in a glossy antique white. This part of southwest Houston was called Sugar Land, and it was sweet indeed: Multimillion-dollar homes were nestled among well-tended golf course greens and tranquil lakes. The senior citizen manning the neighborhood guardhouse had taken a perfunctory glance at Noboru's forged work orders and immediately waved him through. </p><p>With a sigh, Noboru grabbed his utility belt and started up the driveway. But then he slowed, furtively glanced around, and scratched his crew cut. He gazed out past the lawn toward the neighboring home, another mansion where an old man in a pink shirt and oversized sunglasses stood near his Mercedes, preparing to load a golf bag into his trunk. </p><p>Off to Noboru's left lay another spectacular three-story ch�teau with a tremendous brick facade and five-car garage. Noboru studied the windows, trying to spot the lens of a telescopic camera or other such observation device. Nothing. He continued on, but something wasn't right. </p><p>Or was that just his paranoia? Again. They weren't after him anymore. He had a new life now. He needed to believe that. </p><p>Noboru shifted up to the front door, made a call, heard the phone ring inside the house, and then he tapped a series of numbers into his phone and heard the rapid ringtone of the alarm being disarmed. He took out his double-sided lock-pick set and got to work. Three, two, one: The door opened&#x2014;</p><p>And if the explosions hadn't started at the back of the mansion, he would've already been dead. </p><p>Twin thunderclaps resounded, and the ground literally shook beneath his feet as the door slammed back toward him, knocking him to the ground. </p><p>He rolled over, shot to his feet, and sprinted down the driveway. He might as well have been back in Kao-hsiung, chased through the crowded streets by Horatio and Gothwhiler, the night air humid, the sweat pouring down his face. Several more explosions ripped through the house, and he stole a look over his shoulder as huge windows burst outward, sending showers of glass to the driveway while flames shot through the holes and wagged like dragons' tongues. </p><p>He reached the van and whirled around. Clouds of black smoke backlit by more roaring flames now devoured the entire mansion, while fiery debris floated down like confetti and got trapped in the thick canopy of leaves and limbs. </p><p>The old man who'd been loading his golf clubs was now backing out of his driveway. He stopped, climbed out of his car, and hurried over while dialing a number on his phone. </p><p>Noboru's mouth fell open. This was supposed to be a pathetically simple entry to place electronic eyes and ears. In fact, he'd balked over how rudimentary the whole operation was (he was entering through the front door!) and had loathed the fact that Director Grimsd�ttir was wasting his talents on such a menial task. He had only been employed by Third Echelon for less than a year, but didn't his four years with Japan's Special Operations Group, its own Delta Force, count for anything? </p><p>Apparently not...; but what was going on now? </p><p>Were Horatio and Gothwhiler tailing him? Did they know he'd be here? Were they trying to finish the job? If the others learned about them, about Noboru's real past, he would never be trusted. Grimsd�ttir had promised him a new identity, a new life, and utter secrecy. </p><p>A voice crackled in the nickel-sized subdermal embedded in the skin behind his ear; it was the Grim Reaper herself. "Nathan, I'm looking at the satellite feed&#x2014;" </p><p>"I know! I know!" Noboru ran back to the van and yanked open the door. "Ma'am, you'd better call Hansen!" </p><br><p>* * * </p><br><p>VALENTINA was about to stand and thank Leonard for the interview when the man's BlackBerry rang. </p><p>"Please, let me take this, but wait," he said. "I want to introduce you to the rest of my staff." </p><p>"All right." </p><p>He shifted away from the desk and headed toward the window. </p><p>Suddenly, Hansen's voice came through her subdermal. "Maya, get out of there. Now!" </p><p>Even as she gasped, Leonard cried, "What? Oh, my God!" into his phone. </p><p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Leonard, I need to go." </p><p>With that she started for the door, which suddenly took a bullet, the wood splintering as she ducked and craned her neck to see two more rounds punch through the office window, the first striking Leonard in the chest, the second in the shoulder. Blood sprayed across the back wall as Valentina dropped to her hands and knees, drew her SC pistol from her purse, and crawled toward the door. </p><p>She chanced a look back at Leonard, lying there, bleeding, reaching out to her, his mouth working, a word barely forming: "Please...; " </p><br><p>ALLEN Ames was on the building's roof when the shooting began. He'd been up there only as an observer, gathering intel on the comings and goings of visitors to the building and hoping to get some up-close-and-personal pics of at least two of Mr. Leonard's "special" friends from Beijing. </p><p>Ames felt at home on rooftops. He'd grown up in Brooklyn and had spent years atop apartment buildings, hanging out with his friends, getting drunk, and dreaming of a better life that would help him forget about the fire...; about the screams from Mom and Dad, about Katy's face at the window, looking at him, coughing...; until she fell backward into the flames. </p><p>Now, twenty years after that fateful night, Ames was staring down through the telescopic sight of his sniper rifle. The shooter had set up on the roof of a building across the street from Leonard's and had only revealed himself to take the shots. He'd been in Ames's sight for all of two heartbeats before he'd vanished behind the air-conditioning units. Ames had been on the roof since sunrise, and he'd neither seen nor heard the shooter's approach, so the man might have been there even longer and had obviously cloaked his heat signature. </p><p>Ames cursed, slung the rifle over his shoulder, and muttered, "I'm going after the shooter." </p><p>The SVT, or subvocal transceiver, a butterfly-shaped adhesive patch on Ames's throat, just north of his Adam's apple, picked up his voice so it could be broadcast over the channel for all, including Grim, to hear. </p><p>Ames took off, running for the stairwell door, wrenched it open, and began storming down the steps. At just five feet eight and 140 pounds, he was the fastest runner on the team; still, that didn't stop the others from quipping about his size. Oh, they never ridiculed him to his face, but he overheard their remarks. He didn't care. He knew he was ten feet tall when standing on his skills and charisma. Moreover, with a little gel worked into his unruly blond hair, he easily added three inches. </p><p>How many staircases had he mounted during his tenure as a New York City cop, back at the old 4-8 precinct? Too many to count. And just when he'd grown so cynical that he thought he'd abandon public service forever, he'd joined the National Security Agency (NSA) and become a police officer in Fort Meade, Maryland. They'd given him a nice milestone recruitment incentive, and the money and new mission had lifted his spirits. While there, he'd been tapped for Third Echelon&#x2014;despite his lack of a special-forces background&#x2014;and so here he was, back to racing down stairs, trying to help out his fellow Splinter Cells who, of course, had no idea what he really was. </p><p>"You don't have the temperament for this job," Sam Fisher once told Ames during a particularly brutal training session. </p><p>Fisher was a very good judge of character. </p><br><p>* * * </p><br><p>A motley crew of overweight soccer moms hopping around like sea lions in spandex, and fifty-year-old cougars who'd left their rich husbands to lust after group fitness instructors half their age had crowded into the Gold's Gym fitness room for the morning's body-combat class. </p><p>Under the harsh glow of overhead lights that beamed off the waxed wooden floor, the class was in full swing, with the instructor, Greg, booming into a headset while techno music blared from speakers taller than Gillespie. </p><p>Kimberly Gillespie had donned her workout gear and stood within a meter of Mrs. Cynthia Leonard, the fabulously wealthy wife of the team's target. The first break in the music finally came, and they stole a moment to towel off and gulp down their water. </p><p>"You're really good at this," she told Cynthia. </p><p>The woman smoothed back her bleach-blond hair, then blotted sweat off her chest&#x2014;her impossibly perky boobs threatening to explode from her tight top. "Thanks. I've been doing it for a while. Takes time to learn all the punches and kicks. But you look like you've had some training." </p><p>Gillespie smiled. "A little bit." </p><p>"I like you're accent. You're not from Houston." </p><p>"North Georgia." </p><p>"And I love all that red hair and your freckles. You know, I once dated a man who said he stopped for blondes and brunettes, but he took two steps back for redheads." </p><p>Gillespie chuckled under her breath. "I tend to scare away most men. They don't step back. They run." </p><p>"All right, ladies, break time is over," cried Greg. </p><p>"My Lord, he's a real drill sergeant," said Gillespie. </p><p>"Yeah," Cynthia agreed. "But look at that ass." </p><p>The remark reminded Gillespie of army boot camp, of her old friend Lissette, who helped her get through the misery by making jokes and lusting after all the sergeants. The army had allowed Gillespie to escape from Creekwood Trailer Park and her father's grocery list of emotional problems and addictions. She'd finally been able to make a name for herself as an intelligence analyst who advised special-forces teams and operations. </p><p>Four years in the army, then another four years at University of Central Florida to earn a degree in civil engineering, had prepared her well for a career with the NSA. When she was handpicked by Grim herself to join Third Echelon was one of the proudest moments of Gillespie's life. Someone had finally noticed her, recognized her skill set, and appreciated her sarcasm and take-no-prisoners attitude. </p><p>As they were about to move forward and prepare for the next phase of punishment, Cynthia glanced down at the BlackBerry sitting atop her purse and shifted back to take a call. </p><p>Gillespie assumed the fighting stance, then turned as Cynthia suddenly rushed from the room. </p></p><h2>Quintessential Dzogchen: Confusion Dawns as Wisdom</h2><p>This hands-on guidebook adapts the Dzogchen path for the modern student while adhering to traditional principles.

These teachers may not be <i>appointed</i> leaders or <i>paid</i> leaders, but they are <i>committed</i> leaders: they see a need and they respond to it. What do these teacher leaders do that is different from the work of excellent teachers who are not teacher leaders? If we can articulate those skills, says Charlotte Danielson, then we can take steps to enable more teachers to develop those skills and be better equipped to tackle special projects.</p><p><i>Teacher Leadership That Strengthens Professional Practice</i> is designed to be a resource not only for prospective teacher leaders but also for administrators who want to better support the development of outstanding teacher leaders.</p><p>Teachers seeking to expand their leadership capacity will learn how to</p><p><br>* recognize an opportunity and take initiative, <br><br>* mobilize colleagues around a common purpose, <br><br>* marshal resources and take action, <br><br>* monitor and adjust the initiative, <br><br>* sustain the commitments of others, and<br><br>* contribute to the learning organization.<br></p><p>Administrators will find advice on how to cultivate, promote, honor, and empower teacher leaders--and how to work with them to successfully present innovations to the school community.</p><p>In short, this book gives individuals and schools a practical framework for tapping teachers' leadership potential and marshaling their efforts to better educate students and create a stronger learning community.

It brings together a unique combination of Keats's poetry and prose - all the major poems, complemented by a generous selection of Keats's letters - to give the essence of his work and thinking.<br><br>In his tragically short life Keats wrote an astonishing number of superb poems; his stature as one of the foremost poets of the Romantic movement remains unassailable. This volume contains all the poetry published during his lifetime, including Endymion in its entirety, the Odes, "Lamia", and both versions of "Hyperion." The poetry is presented in chronological order , illustrating the staggering speed with which Keats's work matured. Further insight into his creative process is given by reproducing, in their original form, a number of poems that were published posthumously.<br><br>Keats's letters are admired almost as much as his poetry and were described by T. S. Eliot as "certainly the most notable and most important ever written by any English poet." They provide the best biographical detail available and shed invaluable light on Keats's poems.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>John Keats (1795-1821) was one of the principal poets of the English Romantic movement.`among the many virtues of this edition is the fact that it puts the question of Keats and politics high on the agenda.'<br>Jonathan Bate<br><br>`there is much to recommend Elizabeth Cook's carefully devised and generously inclusive edition.'<br>Keats-Shelley Journal</p><h2>Police Field Operations (Always Learning)</h2><p><p> <b>The authoritative text in police field operations.</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> </p> <p>The result of over two years of revisions, <i>Police Field Operations</i>, Eight Edition brings this essential text up to date with the most recent developments in police practices and procedures. For years, Adams has served as the textbook standard for police departments and academies and academic programs across the country.

It focuses on community policing, details how and why certain procedures are used, and provides instructional techniques from leading police academies. </p></p><p></p><h2>Cradle to Grave: Life, Work, and Death at the Lake Superior Copper Mines</h2><p>Concentrating on technology, economics, labor, and social history, <em>Cradle to Grave</em> documents the full life cycle of one of America's great mineral ranges from the 1840s to the 1960s. Lankton examines the workers' world underground, but is equally concerned with the mining communities on the surface. For the first fifty years of development, these mining communities remained remarkably harmonious, even while new, large companies obliterated traditional forms of organization and work within the industry. By 1890, however, the Lake Superior copper industry of upper Michigan started facing many challenges, including strong economic competition and a declining profit margin; growing worker dissatisfaction with both living and working conditions; and erosion of the companies' hegemony in a district they once controlled. Lankton traces technological changes within the mines and provides a thorough investigation of mine accidents and safety. He then focuses on social and labor history, dealing especially with the issue of how company paternalism exerted social control over the work force. A social history of technology, <em>Cradle to Grave</em> will appeal to labor, social and business historians.<br></p><p>Larry Lankton is at Michigan Technological University.<br>"An exceptionally thoughtful, thorough and well-integrated account of labor, business, community and technological change in a fundamental sector of America's second industrial revolution."--Philip Scranton, Rutgers University<p></p><br>"Precisely what is needed in the field: a work which combines personal experience, community life, descriptions of work and a specific physical environment. It allows readers to 'feel' what life was like for these miners and their families."--Patrick Gagnon, Silver Lake College<p></p><br>"Offers rich and thoughtful accounts of technological change as it transformed copper mining....Lankton has offered a penetrating exploration of an important sector of American mining and a model for exploring the interconnections of technological change, management policies, and workplace traditions during industrialization."--<em>Technology and Culture</em><p></p><br>"Will be quite useful to historians...for its many insights into the paternalistic approach to management, especially in its mediation of technological and economic change."--<em>Industrial and Labor Relations Review</em><p></p><br>"Should appeal to a large and varied audience....I recommend it to all readers who enjoy stories of the past."--<em>Wisconsin Magazine of History</em><p></p><br>"A well-researched, interesting account of the rise and decline of the copper mining industry in Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula....Focuses on a hitherto neglected aspect of industrial development, and will particularly interest readers concerned with the history of technology and the evolution of corporate labor policies."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Lankton's study is thematic, taking the reader from the heart of the mines to the rock-crushers on the surface and ethnic residential clusters that surrounded them. It includes admirably clear descriptions of complex technologies and their evolution; has powerful passages on accidents, safety practices, and usually humane company supports for the maimed or widowed; and it is written in a vigorous and engaging style."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"The single-best treatment ever written of the development of Michigan's copper mining region. It breaks new ground with its incisive analysis....One of the finest books written on the history of mining, a welcome addition to the literature on the history of the Great Lakes region, and a real path-breaking work combining the history of technology, work, and business in an extremely readable and enjoyable volume."--<em>Annals of The American Academy of Political and Social Science</em><p></p><br>"This is excellent scholarship that fills a void in regional and mining history literature."--<em>Minnesota History</em><p></p><br>"<em>Cradle to Grave</em> should serve as a model for historians of technology and labor historians as to how both can benefit by combining their interests and thereby deepening their understanding....Lankton writes clearly and with a passion rarely seen in academic writers....Anyone who is interested in Michigan's history will find this a very hard book to put down."--<em>Michigan Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"<em>Cradle to Grave</em> is a comprehensive business, social, and ethnic history that belongs on the bookshelf of anyone seriously interested in nineteenth- and twentieth-century mining, ethnic, business, and social history."--<em>Detroit Free Press</em><p></p><br>"<em>Cradle to Grave</em> provides a fascinating account of the history of the copper mines of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan."--<em>The Journal of American History</em><p></p><br>"An absolutely superb study. Few authors have done as good a job of integrating social, business and economic history with the history of technology and historical geography."--David Killick, University of Arizona<p></p><br>"Lankton gives a fine analysis of life and work in the mines and traces in detail the important technological changes taking place by fits and starts between 1845 and 1910....[A] significant piece of work. Thoroughly researched and thoughtfully written with grace and clarity."--<em>Montana</em><p></p><br>"Much of this ground has been covered before....but nobody has ever done as thorough a job of melding together all of the elements in the industry's history as has Lankton."--<em>Journal of American Ethnic History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Dictionary of Architecture and Construction (Dictionary of Architecture &amp; Construction)</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p></p><p></p><br><b><br></b><br><b>A classic since 1975, the Dictionary of Architecture and Construction is one of the most trusted resources in the AEC community.

His words set Christendom afire. Some 100,000 men, from knights to paupers, took up the call--the largest mobilization of manpower since the fall of the Roman Empire.<br> Now, in <em>The First Crusade</em>, Thomas Asbridge offers a gripping account of a titanic three-year adventure filled with miraculous victories, greedy princes and barbarity on a vast scale. Readers follow the crusaders from their mobilization in Europe (where great waves of anti-Semitism resulted in the deaths of thousands of Jews), to their arrival in Constantinople, an exotic, opulent city--ten times the size of any city in Europe--that bedazzled the Europeans. Featured in vivid detail are the siege of Nicaea and the pivotal battle for Antioch, the single most important military engagement of the entire expedition, where the crusaders, in desperate straits, routed a larger and better-equipped Muslim army. Through all this, the crusaders were driven on by intense religious devotion, convinced that their struggle would earn them the reward of eternal paradise in Heaven. But when a hardened core finally reached Jerusalem in 1099 they unleashed an unholy wave of brutality, slaughtering thousands of Muslims--men, women, and children--all in the name of Christianity.<br> The First Crusade marked a watershed in relations between Islam and the West, a conflict that set these two world religions on a course toward deep-seated animosity and enduring enmity. The chilling reverberations of this earth-shattering clash still echo in the world today.<br></p><p><br><strong>Thomas Asbridge</strong> is Lecturer in Early Medieval History at Queen Mary, University of London. An acknowledged expert on the history of the Crusades, he has traveled extensively in the Near East following the route of the First Crusade.<br><br>"This lively account of the Crusade looks set to replace Steven Runciman's classic 1951 account of the expedition as the best introduction to the subject....Asbridge's book gives exactly the sort of fast-flowing narrative the story demands. He writes clearly and vigorously, with a fine eye for telling detail. Having walked considerable parts of the itinerary the Crusade followed, he presents a vivid picture of the landscapes they passed through. He admires the crusaders' hardiness and extraordinary boldness without condoning cruelties they inflicted....Recommended to a general reader who wants an introduction to the Crusades."--Hugh Kennedy, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Asbridge combines fast-paced history writing, evocative prose and lucid research for a first-rate history of the First Crusade....Brilliantly re-creates the three-year history of the First Crusade, chronicling its difficulties and victories, not downplaying its brutality but emphasizing its genuinely religious impulse."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Balances persuasive analysis with a flair for conveying with dramtic power the crusaders' plight throughout the nine-month siege of Antioch....Stunning...should revitalize the study of this fascinating period in European history."--Christopher Silvester, <em>The Financial Times</em><p></p><br>"Rousing....Asbridge knows this territory well. In 1999, he even walked 350 miles of the crusaders' route."--<em>Christian Science Monitor</em><p></p><br>"Asbridge, in keeping with his aim to produce a popular history, writes with maximum vividness."--Joan Acocella, <em>The New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"Asbridge has produced a taut, clear and exciting narrative, which also manages to convey the best of modern Crusader scholarship....His pace is tremendous, and he has a remarkable feel of place. It certainly helps that, like so many Crusaders nine centuries ago, Asbridge has himself walked 350 miles from Antioch towards Jerusalem."--<em>The Guardian</em><p></p><br>"Although well researched, the book wears its scholarship lightly and reads like a work of fiction, complete with vivid characters."--<em>The Herald</em> (Glasgow)<p></p><br>"Asbridge achieves vivid characterization and gripping storytelling without sacrifice of scholarship. Interweaving analysis, narrative, evocative description and occasional wry humor, he tells us--as no other book on the subject really does--who the crusaders were, how they behaved, how they killed and died and, most surprisingly of all, how they survived and triumphed."--Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto, author of <em>Millennium</em> and <em>Civilizations</em><p></p><br>"There is an underlying assumption among commentators looking at the confrontation between Islam and the West that it has been engendered by the events of September 11, 2001. Thomas Asbridge, by tracing the roots to the First Crusade in his lucid and provocative 'new history,' helps us to understand the present by explaining the past."--Akbar S.

These include billions of dollars in overruns, long delays in design and construction, and poor operability once finally completed.</p> <p><i>Industrial Megaprojects</i> gives you a clear, nontechnical understanding of why these major projects get into trouble, and how your company can prevent hazardous and costly errors when undertaking such large technical and management challenges.</p> <ul> <li>Clearly explains the underlying causes of over-budget, delayed, and unsafe megaprojects</li> <li>Examines effects of poor project management, destructive team behaviors, weak accountability systems, short-term focus, and lack of investment in technical expertise</li> <li>Author is the CEO of the leading consulting firm for evaluating billion-dollar projects</li> </ul> <p>Companies worldwide are rethinking their large-scale projects. <i>Industrial Megaprojects</i> is your essential guide for this rethink, offering the tools and principles that are the true foundation of safe, cost-effective, successful megaprojects.</p></p><p>As megaprojects sponsored by petroleum, chemical, mineral, power, and other related industries have increased in size and com-plexity, so has the fallout. Anyone with a managing stake needs to understand how and why things can go so wrong. <p><i>Industrial Megaprojects</i> explains underlying causes of over-budgeted, delayed, and unsafe megaprojects. They destroy shareholder wealth and damage company reputations. Yet, current global economic needs are further complicating projects. Easily accessed resources have been depleted, national resource holders that control more easily developed oil and gas have driven oil companies into deeper water, and chemical companies seeking lower cost feedstocks need to exploit economies of scale.</p> <p>For anyone who leads or finances big projects, for those who are concerned about the management of modern, publicly owned industrial corporations, and for those who teach others about how it should be done, this book delivers the critical information you need to ensure a safe and profitable future for megaprojects. Modern life depends on their success.</p>More than half of large-scale building projects, such as drilling platforms, chemical plants, or dams, have miserably poor results: billions of dollars in overruns, long delays in design and construction, and poor operability once they are finally completed. Occasionally, these fiascos make the news, but for obvious reasons, companies usually bury the disasters with as little publicity as possible. Yet, management at the companies know full well the complexity and the difficulty faced when mounting megaprojects. <p><i>Industrial Megaprojects</i> explains the underlying causes of over-budgeted, delayed, and unsafe megaprojects: poor project management, destructive team behaviors, weak accountability systems, an almost pathological focus on the short-term, and the unwillingness to invest in deep technical expertise. Modern life as we know it relies on the success of these projects. Leaders and stakeholders of future megaprojects would be wise to heed the warnings and take note of the best practices outlined in this book.</p></p><h2>Prism Level 3 Student&#39;s Book with Online Workbook Listening and Speaking</h2><p>Paired skills course focusing on critical thinking, academic skills, and language students need most.

Here leadership scholar Jean Lipman-Blumen explains what makes the <em>followers</em> tick, exploring why people will tolerate--and remain loyal to--leaders who are destructive to their organizations, their employees, or their nations.<br> Why do we knowingly follow, seldom unseat, frequently prefer, and sometimes even create toxic leaders? Lipman-Blumen argues that these leaders appeal to our deepest needs, playing on our anxieties and fears, on our yearnings for security, high self-esteem, and significance, and on our desire for noble enterprises and immortality. She also explores how followers inadvertently keep themselves in line by a set of insidious control myths that they internalize. For example, the belief that the leader must necessarily be in a position to "know more" than the followers often stills their objections. In addition, outside forces--such as economic depressions, political upheavals, or a crisis in a company--can increase our anxiety and our longing for charismatic leaders. Lipman-Blumen shows how followers can learn critical lessons for the future and survive in the meantime. She discusses how to confront, reform, undermine, blow the whistle on, or oust a toxic leader. And she suggests how we can diminish our need for strong leaders, identify "reluctant leaders" among competent followers, and even nurture the leader within ourselves.<br> Toxic leaders charm, manipulate, mistreat, weaken, and ultimately devastate their followers. <em>The Allure of Toxic Leaders</em> tells us how to recognize these leaders before it's too late.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jean Lipman-Blumen</strong> is Professor of Public Policy and of Organizational Behavior at Claremont Graduate University, California and a co-founding director of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Leadership. Her books include the award-winning <em>Hot Groups: Seeding Them, Feeding Them, and Using Them to</em> <em>Ignite Your Organization</em> and <em>Connective Leadership: Managing in a Changing World</em>, which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.<br><br>"Easily one of the best leadership books of the 1990s was Ron Heifetz's <em>Leadership Without Easy Answers</em>. By explaining why followership is equally demanding, <em>The Allure of Toxic Leaders</em> is a perfect complement."--<em>Financial Times</em><p></p><br>"This book certainly makes interesting election-year reading."--<em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em><p></p><br>"A remarkably comprehensive yet penetrating analysis that sees bad leadership both as morally wrong and psychologically dysfunctional, with practical strategies for reform. A sophisticated study that sees the problem as a failure of followership as well as leadership."--James MacGregor Burns<p></p><br>"It's a long, detailed, thoughtful essay, concentrating on followers and the predicaments they find themselves in with toxic leaders, and the various strategies they employ to extricate themselves. It's rewarding, but not easy, reading."--<em>Globe &amp; Mail</em><p></p><br>"I thought it was an absolutely brilliant book... I've read few books in my life that made me see things from a wholly new perspective. This was one of those very few."--Robert J. Sternberg, Yale University<p></p><br>"A solid look at a dismaying business trend.... Examines the seemingly inexplicable reasons why many employees are loyal to CEOs and politicians who abuse power, cook finances and otherwise virtually destroy their companies.... Offers numerous examples in both politics and business of toxic leaders who have survived crises and received accolades despite their obvious flaws.... The book's strength is the detailed psychological approach to examining the phenomenon of loyalty to toxic leaders."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Whose fault is it that we seem to have so many bad (toxic) leaders today? Jean Lipman-Blumen asserts that everyone's to blame, especially us followers. Beautifully reasoned and intricately argued, she convincingly explains how followers help spawn toxic leaders. Fortunately, she also tells us how to get out of the trap we're in and proposes a highly innovative model of leadership that promises a healthier future."--Jerry I. Porras, Stanford Business School<p></p><br>"In this powerful and eye-opening book, Lipman-Blumen illuminates the darkness of the rarely understood--except to its victims--dangers of evil leadership. She proffers wise counsel and early warnings on how to detect and defend against it. I enthusiastically recommend it to all leaders--and even more, to their vulnerable followers."--Warren Bennis, University of Southern California, author of <em>On Becoming a Leader</em><p></p><br>"Provides remarkable insights into why so many destructive leaders gain and keep power. By explaining the role of followers, Lipman-Blumen makes a profound statement about the nature of leadership itself."--Max De Pree, former CEO of Herman Miller, Inc.<p></p><br>"In our search for leaders, our appraisal of leaders, Jean Lipman-Blumen provides us with a powerful tool to identify, understand and analyze the toxic leader as she gives us fresh observations on our own journey to leadership." --Frances Hesselbein, Chairman, Leader to Leader Institute<p></p><br></p><h2>The Rhetoric of Agitation and Control, Third Edition</h2><p>This compelling text is a careful examination of the rhetoric of dissent. <i>The Rhetoric of Agitation and Control</i> provides a framework for the study of agitation and responses to that agitation. The third edition offers a profile of past and current movements, such as the street theatre of Chicago in 1968 and the innovative and technological rhetorical techniques found in the Battle in Seattle. The modus operandi of today's protests continues to evolve from that of the 1960s and 1970s. As BlackBerries and the Internet replace tie-dyed shirts and flower power, contemporary students and scholars alike will find this edition of <i>The Rhetoric of Agitation and Control</i> to be a helpful tool in studying the progression of social and protest movements.<p> Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Borchers, <i>Persuasion in the Media Age,</i> Third Edition (ISBN 9781577668268); Holmes-Gan, <i>Nonviolence in Theory and Practice,</i> Third Edition (ISBN 9781577667605); Stewart et al., <i>Persuasion and Social Movements,</i> Sixth Edition (ISBN 9781577667773); and Woodward-Denton, <i>Persuasion and Influence in American Life,</i> Seventh Edition (ISBN 9781478607892).</p></p><p></p><h2>My Life and the Final Days of Hollywood</h2><p><p>In the 1940s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was at the epicenter of the film world. Clark Gable, Ava Gardner, Judy Garland, Gene Kelly, and Elizabeth Taylor were only a few of the many stars under contract at the studio. The author, Claude Jarman Jr., takes us from his discovery in a small school in Nashville, Tennessee, through his life among the movie elite. After receiving a special Academy Award for his performance in <em>The Yearling</em> in 1946, he remained at MGM until 1950 when the arrival of television savaged the studio and the star system. He appeared in ten additional films, including playing the son of John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara in John Ford's epic western <em>Rio Grande</em> and <em>Intruder in the Dust</em>, a story of racial strife in Mississippi based on a novel by William Faulkner. After retiring from films in 1956 at the age of twenty-one, he returned to the movie world in 1965 as the director of the San Francisco International Film Festival which reunited him with famous legends in the film industry.</p></p><p>My wife has always told me that I've had an unusual life.&nbsp; Being discovered by Clarence Brown, the Director of <i><b>The Yearling</b></i>, in a classroom one afternoon in the 5th grade totally changed my life.&nbsp; My supportive family was uprooted and we moved to Los Angeles from Nashville.&nbsp; It was a sacrifice for my parents and my sister.&nbsp; Making <b><i>The Yearling</i></b> on location in the bush country of Florida was a tough job as you will read in the book. &nbsp;I vividly remember many of the movies I made including the dialogue.&nbsp; There are fond memories of working with industry greats such as <b>John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Lloyd Nolan, Lee Marvin</b>, etc. As an actor, I was handled with kid gloves.&nbsp; Much of this changed when television was invented and the old studio system as I knew it changed quickly.Another part of my story are my days running the San Francisco International Film Festival.&nbsp; My team and I brought in famous actors, directors, etc. from all over the world for retrospectives.&nbsp; We had the best of the best. &nbsp;I want to thank Sloan De Forest for helping me write my story. Enjoy the book!</p><h2>Alpe d&#39;Huez: The Story of Pro Cycling&#39;s Greatest Climb</h2><p><p>It has been called the Tour de France's 'Hollywood climb', and there is no doubt that Alpe d'Huez has played a starring role in cycling's history since its first encounter with the sport back in 1952 when the legendary Fausto Coppi triumphed on the summit. Re-introduced to the Tour in 1976, Alpe d'Huez has risen to mythical status, thanks initially to a string of victories by riders from Holland, whose exploits attracted tens of thousands of their compatriots to the climb, which has become known as 'Dutch mountain'.</p></p><p>First drawn into the sport while a student in Spain in the mid-1980s, PETER COSSINS has been writing about cycling since 1993. He has covered more than a dozen editions of the Tour de France and spent three years as editor of Procycling magazine and the last five as contributing editor to that title. In 2012 he collaborated with Tour de France winner Stephen Roche on his autobiography, Born to Ride. The Monuments, his history of cycling&#39;s five greatest one-day Classic races, was published in 2014, when he also translated former French pro Christophe Bassons&#39; autobiography, A Clean Break. Resident in Ilkley, he is the co-author of Two Days in Yorkshire, a review of the 2014 Tour&#39;s Grand Depart in the county.<p>&#x2018;A thorough explanation of why Alpe d'Huez can now claim to be the best known climb in cycling&#x2019;</p><br><br><p>'peter cossins has planned and authored this book almost to perfection. his prose, pacing and research are admirable to say the least... and yes, he may be right, alpe d'huez could very well be cycling's greatest climb.'</p><p>'an interesting and revealing account of the great climb'</p><p>�??the highly accessible prose and sheer joy of the writing could tempt even the most casual Sunday cyclists�?� If any one single climb deserves a book all to itself, it�??s the Alpe d�??Huez�??</p><p>'an enjoyable and informative read, loaded with Tour anecdotes and extra-sporting stories'</p><p>�??Cossins meticulously describes every hairpin of [Alpe d�??Huez] with history and colour�?� these are the kind of tales on which cycling thrives.�??</p><p>�??A thorough explanation of why Alpe d'Huez can now claim to be the best known climb in cycling�??</p><br><br><p>'an interesting and revealing account of the great climb'</p><br><br><p>&#x2018;Cossins meticulously describes every hairpin of [Alpe d&#x2019;Huez] with history and colour�?�¿ these are the kind of tales on which cycling thrives.&#x2019;</p></p><h2>The Skeptical Believer: Telling Stories to Your Inner Atheist</h2><p>When it comes to God, there are believers and there are skeptics. But there are also Skeptical Believers, a particular kind of believer who lives with an Inner Atheist that is constantly raising objections. The Skeptical Believer is a book about making peace with your Inner Atheist, and about working out useful responses to questions that have no definitive answers. It steers a middle course between the modernist conviction that faith is agreement with a set of statements about God and the postmodernist assertion that religious faith is just one story among many, no more or less true than any other. The Skeptical Believer proposes that one can live a rich and meaningful life of faith without proof (and despite the weaknesses of the church) by seeing oneself as a character within an ancient story. As believers, skeptical or otherwise, always have.</p><p></p><h2>The Housekeeper&#39;s Tale: The Women Who Really Ran the English Country House</h2><p><p>Working as a housekeeper was one of the most prestigious jobs a nineteenth and early twentieth century woman could want - and also one of the toughest. A far cry from the <i>Downton Abbey</i> fiction, the real life Mrs. Hughes was up against capricious mistresses, low pay, no job security and grueling physical labor. Until now, her story has never been told. <i>The Housekeeper's Tale</i> reveals the personal sacrifices, bitter disputes and driving ambition that shaped these women's careers. Delving into secret diaries, unpublished letters and the neglected service archives of our stately homes, Tessa Boase tells the extraordinary stories of five working women who ran some of Britain's most prominent households.</p><p>There is Dorothy Doar, Regency housekeeper for the obscenely wealthy 1st Duke and Duchess of Sutherland at Trentham Hall, Staffordshire. There is Sarah Wells, a deaf and elderly Victorian in charge of Uppark, West Sussex. Ellen Penketh is Edwardian cook-housekeeper at the sociable but impecunious Erddig Hall in the Welsh borders. Hannah Mackenzie runs Wrest Park in Bedfordshire -&nbsp;Britain's first country-house war hospital, bankrolled by playwright J. M. Barrie. And there is Grace Higgens, cook-housekeeper to the Bloomsbury set at Charleston farmhouse in East Sussex for half a century -&nbsp;an era defined by the Second World War.</p><p>Revelatory, gripping and unexpectedly poignant, <i>The Housekeeper's Tale</i> champions the invisible women who ran the English country house.</p></p><p><p><b></b></p> <b>from The Prologue (Hatfield House, Hertfordshire 1890)</b> <p></p> <p>On Thursday, 16 October 1890, an advertisement appeared in The Times and The Morning Post, London: HOUSEKEEPER WANTED, for a large, country house. A person is required, of a good address, who has filled a similar position. Write, stating qualifications, to S. N., May&#x2019;s Advertising offices, 162 Piccadilly, W. Fifty-nine women read the advertisement, considered their options and replied in slanting copperplate handwriting, stating their particulars.</p> A studio portrait of Hannah Mackenzie Hannah Mackenzie celebrating her 100th birthday <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p>&#x2018;I am a Protestant&#x2019;, wrote Mrs Phillips, 40, from Lambeth, in quavering black ink, &#x2018;an abstainer, early riser, very methodical, punctual in all duties and judicious in supervision of servants. &#x2019; She was experienced in looking after linen, valuable china and stores, she &#x2018;fully understood&#x2019; cooking with economy and she required wages &#x2018;from �35&#x2019; a year. That is around �2,100 in today&#x2019;s money. Mrs Catherine Coleman, housekeeper to the Lord Mayor of London at Mansion House, also applied for the job. She prided herself on being &#x2018;a careful and industrious manageress, possessing a large amount of discretion, tact and judicious firmness necessary to control servants&#x2019;. She was educated, tall, &#x2018;of good appearance and address&#x2019;. She was leaving the post because the Lord Mayor elect would be bringing his own housekeeper. From temporary lodgings at Kemp Street, Brighton Mrs Ridout wrote too. Well educated for her &#x2018;station in life&#x2019;, she thoroughly understood the making of &#x2018;all Preserves, Marmalades, Cakes, etc&#x2019;. She had been &#x2018;disengaged&#x2019; at the precarious age of 50, and was hoping something would turn up.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p>There were replies that appealed to a prospective mistress&#x2019;s vanity, promising to pander to her every need. &#x2018;I shall not consider anything a trouble which will add to the comfort of the household&#x2019;, wrote Mrs Davidson of Mayfair. Kate Corrigan, manageress of the Mosley Hotel in Manchester, understood &#x2018;all the nice little refinements of a wellordered establishment&#x2019;. Her hotel was about to be pulled down and rebuilt; in any case, she would much prefer a position in a &#x2018;house&#x2019;. There were replies from career servants seeking to better their position, such as Miss Bessie Kelly, writing from a &#x2018;gentleman&#x2019;s establishment&#x2019; near Warrington, Cheshire. &#x2018;I want to change now to gain more experience. My age is 38. I think I may say I have a very good address &amp; appearance. &#x2019; Mrs Jennings from West Dean Park, Chichester, was disgruntled with her current job as cook-housekeeper, wishing to drop the &#x2018;cook&#x2019; part. &#x2018;I do not like the management of the cooking and it&#x2019;s more then I thought it would be, but I took the situation through the wishes of Friends. &#x2019; She had been there less than a year.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p>The words &#x2018;large, country house&#x2019; acted as a clarion call. This was the top job for a working woman in the nineteenth century. You could do no better, nor live more comfortably or with greater security, and all under your own steam. Uniquely, it was a life that had no need of a man &#x2013; and was far more exhilarating, perhaps, than housekeeping for a husband. The Victorian years were the housekeeper&#x2019;s apogee, a time of supreme confidence and expansion for the English country house. She started the century a more subordinate, explicitly feminine figure &#x2013; pickler, preserver, sweet maker, distiller; in charge of all store cupboards and material things, a large bunch of keys clinking at her waist as she checked her housemaids&#x2019; work. She ended the century in a black silk dress, a senior management figure of absolute authority, whose wages might outstrip both cook and butler... She answered only to the mistress of the house, hiring and firing dozens of maids and controlling the entire household budget. She remains one of the most caricatured figures of the age.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p>The housekeeper is invariably one of two types. She is a stern-faced, elderly spinster dressed in black &#x2013; meticulous, repressed, asexual, perhaps nursing some secret bitterness. Or else she is a bluff, apple-cheeked Yorkshirewoman, spaniel-like in her devotion. Dickens, himself the grandson of a country-house housekeeper, delighted in the caricature &#x2013; in Hard Times (1854) there is the ludicrous Mrs Sparsit, a widowed gentlewoman fallen on hard times with a &#x2018;Coriolanian style of nose&#x2019; and &#x2018;dense black eyebrows&#x2019;, her preposterous sights set on marrying her master, Mr Bounderby. In Bleak House (1853) there&#x2019;s her counterpoint: the inoffensive treasure Mrs Rouncewell, &#x2018;a fine old lady, handsome, stately, wonderfully neat&#x2019;, an indispensable part of the grand Dedlock Estate for fifty years. Scotswoman Mrs Hughes of the television drama Downton Abbey (loyal, astute, a spinster by choice) belongs firmly in this second camp... For all its status, it was a surprisingly insecure job (1890 was a year of sharp financial recession), many women blaming &#x2018;restructuring of establishment&#x2019; for their being let go. It was also a job for the desperate: widowed and orphaned gentlewomen, young and old, down on their luck. Their letters make poignant reading.</p> Holkham Hall <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p>On black-edged notepaper from Bridgnorth in the old county of Salop, a 24-year-old widow applied for the post. &#x2018;Owing to my husband&#x2019;s recent death I have been obliged to depend upon myself &#x2019;, wrote Frances Christy in intelligent, legible handwriting. &#x2018;I have never been out before, but am a lady and used to house keeping of my own, and am fully qualified for the post, being used to a large house in China, and having the command of a staff of servants.

This definitive volume, with a new introduction by Holzer's daughter, is the largest collection of his work ever published. In <em>Ghosts</em>, Dr. Holzer tells us how to find a ghost, how to communicate with a ghost, how to get rid of a ghost, and then he tells us about more than 150 stories of true encounters with ghosts. Featuring rare photographs of ghostly apparitions and visitations, Holzer presents fascinating case histories, tips on interpreting sounds and other signals from the beyond, and more. Not only does Dr. Holzer introduces us to visitors from the next dimension, he explains why they seek contact with our world. <em>Ghosts </em>is a must-read for all would-be ghost hunters and fans of the otherworldly. <br><br><br></p><p>Hans Holzer is a world-renowned parapsychologist and author of several paranormal books including <i>Are You Psychic?</i> and <i>Ghosts, Hauntings &amp; Possessions</i>, in which we learn of Holzer's earlier forays into the world of the supernatural. His encounters with the undead are apparently never-ending. <i>Ghosts: True Encounters with the World Beyond</i> is a gigantic volume, documenting almost 200 cases of haunted houses, ships, castles, and just about any place imaginable! The cases are far more complex than just your average white-sheeted ghoul in the attic. Holzer examines the differences between "real ghosts," who reveal themselves to living people, and psychic impressions, which occur to many witnesses, always at the same time and place. There is also solid advice for interpreting paranormal signals--and even photographs of ghostly apparitions. This is an informative read, but one that is open to personal interpretation. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i><i>Take a journey to the world beyond...</i><br><ul><li>Visit hundreds of haunted places around the world.</li><li>Learn how to make contact with "the other side."</li><li>Read about ghostly manifestations of all kinds, from phantoms to poltergeists&#x2014;and learn about the scientific investigations that have uncovered and authenticated them.</li><li>See rare, genuine photographs of ghosts and spirits, and find out how these apparitions were captured on film.</li></ul><br>Travel to all corners of the world in search of ghosts with Dr. Hans Holzer, one of the world's foremost experts on the subject and the author of more than 100 books on parapsychology, the supernatural, and the paranormal phenomena.

G. Jung: A Collaboration</h2><p>Captivating, astute, and often endearing, <i>Toni Wolff &amp; C. G. Jung</i> tells the story of the most enigmatic woman in the creative life of C. G. Jung--Toni Wolff. Wolff was Jung's primary&nbsp;collaborator during the formative years of his psychological investigations. From the start, their interests meshed, and they brought out the best in each other's thinking. Not afraid to challenge Jung's ideas, Wolff fueled his creativity. Her brilliant mind gave him focus, while her sensitive nature kindled his imagination. Together, they explored the uncharted regions of the psyche.<br>At the same time, she introduced Jung to the life of&nbsp;<i>eros</i>, that vibrancy of experience he would later describe as the inner&nbsp;<i>daimon</i>&nbsp;of relationship. She was his muse, his confidante, and his inspiratrice--the dark, inscrutable woman he would call his "other wife." Yet she remains virtually unknown, a mystery--at best a footnote to Jung.&nbsp;<br>Independently, Wolff was a scholar in her own right, creating an original model of the feminine psyche, memorialized in her landmark essay, "Structural Forms of the Feminine Psyche." This book examines her signature essay, along with her other essays--mostly unknown--which offer insight into her sentiments, beliefs, and life choices.&nbsp;<br>For the first time, the life and work of Toni Wolff along with her complex relationship with C. G. Jung comes to light through personal letters, archival documents, impressions from her family, insights from Wolff's personal diaries, and statements made by Wolff and Jung themselves.Further enriched by the inclusion of dozens of historic photographs, Toni Wolff &amp; C. G. Jung tells the story of the love and genius behind analytical psychology.</p><p>"<i>Toni Wolff &amp; C.G. Jung: A Collaboration&nbsp;</i>is a story that truly needs to be told. Nan Savage Healy richly documents the life and legacy of Toni Wolff and her relationship to C. G. Jung, as well as demonstrates that Wolff must be recognized as a co-creator of analytical psychology. I was deeply impressed by Healy's scholarly ability and the eloquence of her writing. Her method demonstrates careful historical research, and the story is greatly enriched by her depth psychological sensibilities. Again and again, I was struck by her insights pertaining to Wolff and Jung. I was eager and delighted to read this book!"<br><ul> - Patrick J. Mahaffey Ph.D., Professor of Mythological Studies, Pacifica Graduate Institute</ul><br><br>"Here is the first major book about Toni Wolff and her key role in the unfolding of C.G. Jung's life and thought. Often overlooked or downplayed--sometimes deliberately--her role as his collaborator, not to mention as his <i>anima&nbsp;</i>and <i>soror mystica</i>, can no longer be minimized. Jung would not have been the same without her, and you will not think the same about Jung or Wolff after reading Nan Savage Healy's <i>Toni Wolff &amp;C.G.

For decades after, the Siletz people lost many traditional customs, saw their languages almost wiped out, and experienced poverty, killing diseases, and humiliation. Again and again, the federal government took great chunks of the magnificent, timber-rich tribal homeland, a reservation of 1.1 million acres reaching a full 100 miles north to south on the Oregon Coast. By 1956, the tribe had been &#x201c;terminated&#x201d; under the Western Oregon Indian Termination Act, selling off the remaining land, cutting off federal health and education benefits, and denying tribal status. Poverty worsened, and the sense of cultural loss deepened.<br><br>The Siletz people refused to give in. In 1977, after years of work and appeals to Congress, they became the second tribe in the nation to have its federal status, its treaty rights, and its sovereignty restored. Hand-in-glove with this federal recognition of the tribe has come a recovery of some land--several hundred acres near Siletz and 9,000 acres of forest--and a profound cultural revival.<br><br>This remarkable account, written by one of the nation&#x2019;s most respected experts in tribal law and history, is rich in Indian voices and grounded in extensive research that includes oral tradition and personal interviews.

Evolutionary theory, social Darwinism, and racial anthropology had been dominant doctrines in international relations from its beginnings; racist attitudes informed research priorities and were embedded in newly formed professional organizations. In <i>White World Order, Black Power Politics</i>, Robert Vitalis recovers the arguments, texts, and institution building of an extraordinary group of professors at Howard University, including Alain Locke, Ralph Bunche, Rayford Logan, Eric Williams, and Merze Tate, who was the first black female professor of political science in the country. </p><p>Within the rigidly segregated profession, the "Howard School of International Relations" represented the most important center of opposition to racism and the focal point for theorizing feasible alternatives to dependency and domination for Africans and African Americans through the early 1960s. Vitalis pairs the contributions of white and black scholars to reconstitute forgotten historical dialogues and show the critical role played by race in the formation of international relations.</p></p><p><p>Robert Vitalis is Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of<i> America&#x2019;s Kingdom: Mythmaking on the Saudi Oil Frontier </i>and <i>When Capitalists Collide: Business Conflict and the End of Empire in Egypt</i> and coeditor of <i>Counter-Narratives: History, Society and Politics in Saudi Arabia and Yemen</i>.</p><p>"The study of international relations was not born to promote peace among equal states but rather to help ensure racial subjugation on a global scale. This is the startling, bold, and persuasive argument of Robert Vitalis's <i>White World Order, Black Power Politics</i>. This is a book that anyone interested in race relations, international relations, and empire will need to read, and they will all thank Vitalis for daring to write it."</p> (Julian Go, author of <i>Patterns of Empire</i>)<br><br><p>"This landmark book provides a superbly well-researched history of the racist underpinnings and practices of International Relations as it first emerged in the United States, and across the Atlantic. Its core analyses &#x2013; sustained through a detailed recounting of the arguments and politics of individual scholars, philanthropists, and the then nascent funding institutions and think tanks - challenge and serve to demystify the mythology of IR as a field of interstate relations. The discipline was established first and foremost to analyze interracial relations and the sustenance of white supremacy. <i>White World Order, Black Power Politics</i> shows how IR, like many social and historical sciences, responded to the imagined imperatives of racial and colonial management. Moreover, the book excavates the hidden history of American IR by bringing to light the contributions to the study of world politics of a group of extraordinary African American scholars, who collectively Vitalis calls the 'Howard School of international relations theory': Alain Locke, Ralph Bunche, E. Franklin Frazier, Rayford Logan, Merze Tate, and Eric Williams, alongside W. E. B. Du Bois, worked to resist these racist premises and imperial imperatives between the late nineteenth and mid-twentieth century. Their struggles reveal not only IR's white supremacist origins, but also why this past may not have yet been surpassed. An intellectual and historical tour de force."</p> (Award Citation, Sussex International Theory Prize)<br><br><p>"A revelation, a provocation, and an inspiration, <i>White World Order, Black Power Politics</i> is required reading for everyone who studies, teaches, or practices international relations in the United States. In reconstructing a lost history of the impact of race and racism in the American study and practice of international relations, Robert Vitalis exposes congenital deformations in the field all the more grave for being invisible and ensures that we will never look at what we do the same way again."</p> (Lisa Anderson, author of <i>Pursuing Truth, Exercising Power</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>White World Order, Black Power Politics</i> is a groundbreaking book that has the potential to transform our understanding of a key dimension of twentieth-century American social science. It also contains important, albeit uncomfortable, lessons for contemporary scholars of international politics. Drawing on a vast range of primary sources, Robert Vitalis demonstrates that from the origins of the field until deep into the Cold War, IR helped to serve the interests of the imperial powers and provided an intellectual rationale for the claims of global white supremacy.

An avid sailor and pilot, Woods lives in Florida, Maine, and New Mexico.<b>1</b><p>ED EAGLE SAT, all six feet seven inches of him, propped up on many pillows in bed, watching Court TV on the fifty-inch flatscreen television of his suite at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles. He had decided to watch from bed rather than attend the trial of his former wife, Barbara, since he had already spent three days in the courtroom, giving his testimony against her. Now it was time for the summations.<br>The prosecutor, a woman apparently in her midthirties named Valerie Simmons, whom Eagle found quite attractive, had done a very good job in the trial, he thought, and since he was one of the half dozen best trial lawyers in the western United States, his opinion counted for something. Now all Ms. Simmons had to do was nail the lid on the thing. Eagle would have preferred nailing and screwing the lid on it, but he would settle for nailing&#x2014;anything to get Barbara into a cell for the next fifty years or so.<br>Eagle&#x2019;s girlfriend of the last year, the actress Susannah Wilde, came out of the bathroom, her hair wet, her robe hanging open. She crawled across his body, deliberately stroking his face with her breasts as she went, and snuggled up next to him.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t wave those things at me,&#x201d; Eagle said. &#x201c;I have to watch Barbara go down.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t you rather watch me go down?&#x201d; Susannah asked, tickling his lower belly.<br>&#x201c;On another occasion, yes,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;But right now you&#x2019;re going to have to contain yourself, as difficult as that may be.&#x201d;<br>Susannah sighed and pulled herself upright next to him, plumping her pillows. &#x201c;Oh, all right,&#x201d; she said.<br>Valerie Simmons rose and walked toward the jury. &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen,&#x201d; she said to them, &#x201c;I want to thank you for your attention to what has been a lengthy trial. Now, I want to summarize the evidence against Barbara Eagle, as succinctly as I can, and I would remind you that everything I am about to say has been testified to by witnesses. You have heard from Ms. Eagle&#x2019;s former husband, Ed Eagle, how he first met Ms. Eagle when she was serving a prison sentence in New York for armed robbery and as an accessory to the killing of her first husband during that robbery. You have heard how she was released on parole and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where she renewed her acquaintance with Mr. Eagle, and how they came to be married a year or so later.<br>&#x201c;You have heard how Mr. Eagle woke up one morning, having been drugged with the sleeping pill Ambien in his wine the night before, and found his wife gone, and how she had taken more than a million dollars of his money from his bank accounts and attempted to take five million more from his brokerage accounts, something he managed to forestall.<br>&#x201c;You have heard how Mr. Eagle hired two private investigators to find his wife in Mexico, where she had fled, and how she shot one of the investigators and pushed the other overboard from a ferry in the Sea of Cortez. Both were lucky to survive. You have heard how she hired two men from Santa Fe to murder Mr. Eagle and how one of them nearly succeeded.<br>&#x201c;You have heard how she came back to the United States and checked into a resort in San Diego, where she had her appearance altered by having her dark hair dyed blond and with cosmetic surgery. You have heard how she then traveled to Los Angeles and contacted a friend, Mr. James Long, and how they had dinner together that evening at the Hotel Bel-Air. You have heard that Mr. Eagle and a friend were also dining there and how he did not recognize Ms. Eagle, because of her altered appearance.<br>&#x201c;You have heard how Ms. Eagle, later that night, drugged her companion, Mr. Long, once again with Ambien, left his home, returned to the Hotel Bel-Air and sought out the suite of Mr. Eagle. You have heard how she entered the suite next door, in error, and shot Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Dattila of New York, believing that they were Mr. Eagle and his friend.<br>&#x201c;All of this is in evidence, and the weight of it is enough for you to send Ms. Eagle to prison for the rest of her life. I ask you to do just that. Thank you.&#x201d; Valerie Simmons sat down.<br>The judge turned to the defense table. &#x201c;Mr. Karp?&#x201d; he said.<br>Richard Karp rose and faced the jury. &#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, this case is about reasonable doubt. If you believe that there is a reasonable doubt that Barbara Eagle killed Mr. and Mrs. Dattila&#x2014;and that is all that she is charged with&#x2014;then you are legally and morally bound to acquit her. Everything you have heard from the prosecution about Ms. Eagle&#x2019;s past and what she may or may not have done in Mexico is window dressing, nothing more, and none of what you have heard is supported by any material evidence, just the testimony of questionable witnesses.<br>&#x201c;While you heard Mr. Eagle testify that he was drugged with Ambien, there is no scientific evidence to support that contention. What happened was that Mr. Eagle had too much to drink the evening before and overslept. The funds that Ms. Eagle took with her to Mexico, in a desperate attempt to remove herself from an abusive marriage, were marital funds, and she was legally entitled to take them. I would remind you that one of the two men allegedly hired to kill Mr. Eagle is dead, and the other could not pick Ms. Eagle out of a lineup.<br>&#x201c;I would remind you that it is not a crime in the United States to shoot someone in Mexico in self-defense or to push someone off a boat in an attempt to defend herself from a rape, and you have heard that both of her attackers survived. I would remind you that, although Ms. Eagle and Mr. Long dined at the Bel-Air the evening before the murder, you have also heard, from Mr. Long, that she spent the entire night in his bed in his home and did not return to the Bel-Air to shoot Mr. Dattila, who, you have heard, was the son of the Mafia kingpin Carmine Dattila, who also met a violent death. It is far more likely that Thomas Dattila was killed by his own associates or competitors than by Ms. Eagle.<br>&#x201c;I would remind you that Mr. James Long underwent no testing for the drug Ambien, and he has testified that Ms. Eagle spent the night with him&#x2014;indeed, that they made love in the middle of the night. I would remind you that it is not a crime for a woman to have her appearance enhanced by her hairstylist and her cosmetic surgeon.&#x201d; He smiled knowingly.<br>&#x201c;In fact, stripped to its relevant essentials, the prosecution&#x2019;s case is nothing more than a lot of hot air, backed only by the testimony of an angry ex-husband and the two private detectives he hired to bully and harass her and to come into this court and lie about her. There is no physical evidence, no murder weapon and no motive for the murders of two people Ms. Eagle had never even met.<br>&#x201c;I put it to you that the doubt of guilt in this case is not only reasonable but overwhelming, and I ask you, after a careful examination of the evidence&#x2014;or, rather, nonevidence&#x2014;to acquit Barbara Eagle and set her free, so that she may still have a chance to find some happiness in what has, so far, been a life full of abuse and harassment by her ex-husband and others. Find her not guilty.&#x201d; Karp sat down.<br>&#x201c;What did you think?&#x201d; Susannah asked.<br>&#x201c;Well, they both said pretty much what I would have said, if I had been prosecuting or defending,&#x201d; Eagle said. &#x201c;I think the jury will convict her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, then,&#x201d; Susannah said, &#x201c;while the jury is deliberating, may I distract you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You may,&#x201d; Eagle said, rolling over and taking her in his arms.<br>SHE HAD BEEN distracting him for ten minutes or so, when Eagle was redistracted by a sudden intensity in the voice of the Court channel&#x2019;s anchor.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re just getting word,&#x201d; the anchor said, &#x201c;that something has happened outside the courtroom where the trial of Barbara Eagle has just ended. Let&#x2019;s go to our reporter on the scene for the details.&#x201d;<br>A beautiful young woman in a red suit and with perfect hair came on-screen. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said, breathlessly, &#x201c;it seems that Barbara Eagle has disappeared from the conference room where she and her lawyer were awaiting a verdict. Apparently, while Mr. Karp had excused himself to go to the men&#x2019;s room, Ms. Eagle somehow got out of the conference room, in spite of a guard on the door, and maybe even out of the building. A search is being conducted for her now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ed,&#x201d; Susannah said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ve gone all limp.&#x201d;</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>BARBARA EAGLE SAT at the table in a conference room near the courtroom where she had just been tried, awaiting the jury&#x2019;s verdict. She had had lunch in this room every day during her trial, so she knew that it was on the first floor and overlooked the rear parking lot of the courthouse, reserved for judges. She knew, also, that the windows would open only ten or twelve inches, and only from the top.<br>She had been keeping her lawyer&#x2019;s water glass full for two hours, and she was waiting for results. Finally, he excused himself and went into the adjoining toilet. Barbara moved quickly. She climbed onto the windowsill, stuffed her shoes, handbag and jacket through the top opening of the window, then grabbed the bottom of the opening on the extreme left and swung her right, stockinged foot up until she could hook a toe over the edge of the window. From this point, it was all muscle, and she had had nearly a year in jail to work out. She lifted herself until she could get a knee over the edge, then continued until all that was left of her inside the room was her head, one leg and her ass. She turned to the left, and got her head out the window. From there she wriggled her ass through the window&#x2014;the dieting had helped&#x2014;then all she had to do was bring her leg outside after her.<br>She dangled from the window and took a quick look around the parking lot: a man got out of a car and went into the building through a rear door, but he wasn&#x2019;t looking up, and the parking lot was screened from the street by a high hedge. Once he was inside she dropped to the ground, a distance of some seven or eight feet, landed on the soft earth of a flower bed, behind some azalea bushes, and toppled over. She got up, brushed herself off, put on her shoes, grabbed her handbag and walked quickly across the parking lot to the row of ficus trees that had begun to grow together.<br>She pressed between them, then stopped halfway through to get a look at the street. The Toyota was parked where it was supposed to be, and Jimmy Long was at the wheel. There were no police cars or cops in sight, so she stepped out of the hedge, crossed the sidewalk, opened the rear door of the car and got in. &#x201c;Hey, Jimmy,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;Hey, sweetie, we okay?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yep. Let&#x2019;s roll.&#x201d; Barbara lay low on the backseat, and the car started to move.<br>&#x201c;Where to?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The nearest place you can get a taxi.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a hotel a few blocks down.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good.&#x201d; Her luggage was sitting on the rear seat and floor, and Barbara rummaged in a bag and came out with an auburn wig and a green jacket. She tucked her hair, which was already pinned up, under the wig, sat up and checked herself out in the rearview mirror, then she got into the green jacket and stuffed her beige one into the bag. &#x201c;Okay, brief me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The car belonged to my housekeeper&#x2019;s sister, who has a last name different from hers. I bought it and registered it in your new name, Eleanor Wright. I went to see the photographer you sent me to in Venice, and he was able to change the hair color on the last photos he took of you and make you the same package of documents he did for you before&#x2014;passport, driver&#x2019;s license, credit cards, Social Security&#x2014;all with my address on them. Ms. Wright used to rent my garage apartment, but she left a couple of months ago, if anybody asks. Everything is in a paper bag on the front passenger seat.<br>&#x201c;The car registration and insurance card are in the center armrest, along with a nontraceable cell phone, prepaid for a hundred hours of use, no GPS chip, blocked for caller ID. I went to the pawnshop in San Diego where you shopped last year and got the gun and silencer you wanted and a box of ammunition. There&#x2019;s ten thousand dollars in mixed bills in the bag, too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a dear, do you know that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sweetheart, this is the most fun I&#x2019;ve ever had; I&#x2019;ve loved every minute of it. I took the letter you sent me and used it to transfer the money into your Eleanor Wright account, so you&#x2019;ve got a little over two hundred and fifty grand in there. You can write me a check for the ten grand, plus eighteen grand for the car, plus the twenty-five grand I paid the documents guy.&#x201d; He handed her a checkbook, and she wrote the check and handed it to him.<br>&#x201c;Oh, there&#x2019;s another bag on the seat, too, with the auburn hair dye and the book on spas you wanted. Everything you stored in my garage is in the backseat, but it will probably need pressing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jimmy, you&#x2019;re a dream. Now you&#x2019;ve got to get home before the cops show up. They&#x2019;re missing me at the courthouse by now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the hotel,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get out and hop a cab. You just drive away.&#x201d; He stopped the car.<br>She got out, gave him a hug and a kiss and got back into the car.<br>Jimmy leaned through the window. &#x201c;The car has twenty-two thousand miles on it, it&#x2019;s just been serviced and the gas tank is full. Good luck, kiddo.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in touch when I can,&#x201d; Barbara said. She put the car in gear and drove away, careful to obey all traffic laws. At the first opportunity, she pulled into a fast-food restaurant and ordered lunch from the drive-thru.<br>When she had eaten, she went through her new ID and put everything into the wallet in her handbag, then restowed her luggage in the trunk. Finally, she took the book on spas and began to read. It took her twenty minutes to find just the right place, called El Rancho, secluded on a mountaintop overlooking Palm Springs. She used her new cell phone to call.<br>&#x201c;Good morning. El Rancho,&#x201d; a woman&#x2019;s voice said.<br>&#x201c;Good morning. My name is Eleanor Wright, and I&#x2019;ve just had a sudden urge to get away from it all. Do you have any accommodation available?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see, we have a small suite at twelve hundred dollars per day and a double room at nine hundred. The suite has the better view, and the price includes all meals and drinks. No liquor is served. We offer a full range of spa activities, a beauty salon, tennis and golf half an hour&#x2019;s drive away.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take the suite, please. Would you schedule me for a two-hour massage at five P.M. and make an appointment with the hairdresser and a colorist for tomorrow morning?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course. May I have a credit card number to hold your reservation?&#x201d;<br>Barbara gave it to her and got driving directions from the interstate. On the way she stopped at a liquor store and bought a bottle of good bourbon whiskey.<br>AS SOON AS she had checked into her suite, Barbara unpacked, then went into the bathroom and used the auburn hair dye, cleaning up after herself carefully. She left her hair wet and combed it back. Tomorrow, she would have a better job done by a professional. She had her massage, then dinner in her room, along with a couple of large scotches, then settled down to watch the TV coverage of her escape. Finally, she fell asleep.<br>SHE WOKE THE following morning to learn from the TV that she had been acquitted of second-degree murder. &#x201c;Holy shit!&#x201d; she said aloud. She hadn&#x2019;t figured on that.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p>ED EAGLE NEARLY choked on his eggs. &#x201c;Susannah!&#x201d; he yelled.<br>She stuck her head around the bathroom door. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Barbar...</p></p><h2>Dream Eyes (Dark Legacy)</h2><p><b>A suspicious death.

It&#x2019;s that the things even a nitwit could do with little or no instruction often confused me. Simple, everyday sorts of things tripped me up. Stacking metal chairs, for example. Everybody in class just seemed to know exactly how to fold the seat up into the back and then nest them all together like Pringles potato chips. I sat on the floor for ten minutes with one of the things as if somebody had told me to just stare at it. Concentrate hard, Augusten, try and turn it into an eggplant with your mind. You can do it! The other children appeared to be born with some sort of innate knowledge, as though the action of folding and stacking child-size metal school chairs was gene tically encoded within each of them, like fingernails or a sigmoid colon. <br>I seemed to lack the ability to comprehend the obvious. From the very beginning there had been warning signs.<br>Like every kid just starting school, I had to memorize the Pledge of Allegiance&#x2014;something that would in many towns today be considered prayer and therefore forbidden; akin to forcing a child to drink the blood of a sacrificial goat or unfurl a Tabriz prayer rug and kneel barefoot on it while facing Mecca. <br>While I managed to learn the words, memorizing isn&#x2019;t the same as understanding. And of course I was never tested on the meaning of the pledge. It must have simply been taken for granted that even the dimmest child would easily grasp the meaning of a phrase such as I pledge allegiance, especially when that phrase was spoken while standing at strict attention and facing the American flag, hand in a salute above the heart. There was so little room for misinterpretation. It was the Pledge of Allegiance, not Are You There God? It&#x2019;s Me, Margaret. <br>Still. If one of the teachers had asked me to explain the meaning of those words&#x2014;which I chanted parrot- minded and smiling each morning&#x2014;they certainly would have been shocked to hear me admit that while I didn&#x2019;t know exactly what it was about, I knew it had something to do with Pledge, the same furniture polish my mother used and that always, inexplicably, made me feel sunny. So each morning as I spoke those hallowed words, it was the bright yellow can with the glowing lemony scent that I pictured.

Brace yourself. You might not want to hear this: Office work is boring.</p><p>Okay, maybe that wasn&#x2019;t a shock. But when you fantasize about being a private eye, when you work and plan and visualize yourself opening a real business with real clients walking through the door with exciting, life-and-death problems to solve . . . Well, let&#x2019;s just say there are a lot of hours in the workday.</p><p>The red-and-black signage on the front window of our establishment reads MONK &amp; TEEGER, CONSULTING DETECTIVES. I would be the Teeger. Natalie Teeger, single mom, ex-bartender, ex&#x2013;blackjack dealer, ex-assistant to a brilliant and dysfunctional crime consultant. The Monk would be Adrian Monk, ex-cop and my ex-boss. We&#x2019;re in this thing together now, trying to share our modest office space in a mini-mall without annoying each other to death.</p><p>Even though my name is listed second, I&#x2019;m the official boss. I&#x2019;m the one who took the time and effort to get my investigator&#x2019;s license. But Monk is the one with the genius for solving any possible or impossible case&#x2014;except his own case of OCD. You probably know all of this. Right? As I said, I&#x2019;ve been bored and I&#x2019;m starting to repeat myself.</p><p>Lately we&#x2019;ve taken to splitting our hours, just to give each other a break. At first I was nervous about it. But Monk surprised me with his ability to open up the shop by himself and deal with the demands of a storefront and not scare away too many clients. He does have this habit of making mortal enemies with the other fine businesses facing onto our communal parking lot. But we&#x2019;re working on that. Baby steps.</p><p>It was exactly one o&#x2019;clock on a cloudy afternoon when I pulled my Subaru into an empty spot just as Monk and Luther Washington were coming out the door.</p><p>As long as I&#x2019;m saying things you probably already know, I&#x2019;ll mention Luther. He&#x2019;s Monk&#x2019;s driver. Not really a driver. But a year or so ago, Monk met Luther and bought his car service company. Luther stayed on to manage the business and give Monk a free ride whenever he needs one. I&#x2019;m sure Monk could have avoided the expense of buying a company and simply paid for his rides. But that would have provided Luther with an exit strategy he doesn&#x2019;t have now. Luther is financially forced to be Monk&#x2019;s friend. And, except for a few hiccups along the way, I think it&#x2019;s working.</p><p>It seemed to be working on that afternoon when I pulled up. The two of them were acting like a couple of schoolboys, scurrying around the side of the black Town Car. Luther held open the passenger door for Monk, then put on his cap and got behind the wheel. They were almost giggling.</p><p>&#x201c;How was your morning?&#x201d; I asked through the open window, trying to keep things professional. &#x201c;Any exciting business I should be aware of?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exciting,&#x201d; Monk echoed, then seemed to change his mind. &#x201c;Uh, no. Nothing exciting. We got an inquiry about a child custody case, which I turned down. The landlord came by with a plumber to check out that smell in the bathroom. They said it&#x2019;s my imagination, but my imagination doesn&#x2019;t smell like that. I&#x2019;ll call them again in an hour. Oh, and the hippies next door are still making a racket. You don&#x2019;t even have to press your ear to the wall to hear their antiestablishment music. It&#x2019;s practically blaring.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; said Luther with half a grin. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re really causing pain.&#x201d;</p><p>Monk answered that with half a chortle. &#x201c;Causing pain. Good one.&#x201d;</p><p>Hmm. I wasn&#x2019;t aware that Luther had even met the hippies. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, stretching out the word. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up with you two?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing, boss,&#x201d; said Monk, and he rolled up the window. &#x201c;Go, go,&#x201d; I could hear from behind the tinted glass as Luther scooted back out of the space.</p><p>I watched them drive off, make a right onto Divisadero, and blend in with the downtown traffic. Okay, I thought, heaving a deep sigh. Time to visit the hippies and apologize. For whatever.</p><p>The hippies, as Monk called them, owned Paisley Printing, the shop just to the right of ours as you face the parking lot. Peter and Wendy Gerber were probably still in their twenties, thin and scruffy. Back in the seventies, they might have been labeled hippies. Since then, other labels have come and gone to describe their look: granola, new age, sixties retro&#x2014;or, to quote my father, old-school San Franciscans.</p><p>Peter and Wendy were sweet and good-natured, struggling to make ends meet in a business dominated by the likes of Kinko&#x2019;s and Office Depot, not to mention the surge in desktop publishing. They certainly didn&#x2019;t deserve to have Adrian Monk holding his nose every time he smelled a whiff of incense, or his pounding on the thin walls every time he heard the music of the old guitar that Peter plucked on during the spells between their printing jobs.</p><p>&#x201c;Natalie,&#x201d; Wendy called out warmly through the open door. At least she still considered us on speaking terms.</p><p>&#x201c;Wendy. How is everything? I hope Adrian hasn&#x2019;t been bothering you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Adrian? What a sweet old soul he has. No, I haven&#x2019;t seen him.&#x201d; Wendy was a long-haired brunette, but with the kind of frizzy, flyaway hair you might expect on someone my age. She swept back a long strand. &#x201c;I expected to see him pacing out front, you know, spooking away customers, only we don&#x2019;t have any customers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Natalie.&#x201d; Peter was toward the back of the shop, looking up from a laptop. He sported a scruffy three-day growth that always looked the same. &#x201c;I love it when Adrian pounds the wall. He can&#x2019;t help but keep time, so it&#x2019;s like I&#x2019;ve got my own drum section. Freakin&#x2019; cool.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My bad. We did have a customer,&#x201d; Wendy recalled. &#x201c;Clyde. I forget his last name. African-American dude with a very centered aura.&#x201d; She held up her hands as if holding the aura for me to examine. &#x201c;Teeny tiny order but super weird. We wasted all morning getting it right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Time is never a waste,&#x201d; Peter corrected her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an artificial construct reflecting the circular flow of the universe. We&#x2019;re all part of it, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind him.&#x201d; Wendy laughed. &#x201c;You can decide for yourself if it was a waste.&#x201d; And with that, she led me behind the counter to the monitor on top of the main, white-laminate work space. &#x201c;I guess it&#x2019;s for a clinic or a medical supply business?&#x201d; She phrased it as a question.</p><p>Wendy used her mouse to bring up the image of a poster. The letters were big, almost magenta on a multicolored background, in a kind of retro-forties font. There was no illustration to speak of, just four oddly spaced words filling the lower part of the sign, plus an arrow.</p><p>HIP<br>CAUSING YOU PAIN?</p><p>&#x201c;I guess it&#x2019;s a window ad,&#x201d; I suggested. &#x201c;For a hip replacement facility? You&#x2019;re right. It is super weird. How big was the final product?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Clyde was very specific,&#x201d; said Peter as he joined us at the worktable. &#x201c;It had to be exactly two feet two inches by three feet seven and a half inches. He kept looking at a photo, but real James Bond secret-like. He kept fiddling with the color and spacing. It must have taken us an hour plus.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And after all that, he only wanted one copy,&#x201d; said Wendy, shaking her frizz. &#x201c;We kept telling him a dozen would be almost as cheap, but he said he only needed one. Matte finish on a self-adhesive plastic-peel backing. All-natural inks, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did he pay cash?&#x201d; I asked. I had a sinking feeling about this story. &#x201c;Did he wait and take it with him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; said Peter. &#x201c;Both of those. It&#x2019;s like you&#x2019;re tapping into his spirit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unfortunately, I think I am.&#x201d; From the start there had been something familiar about the font and the colors&#x2014;and, now that I thought about it, about the African-American man . . . and the phrase &#x201c;causing pain,&#x201d; which I&#x2019;d run into more than once in the past few minutes. Just call me Sherlock.</p><p>&#x201c;Natalie, where are you going?&#x201d;</p><p>Peter and Wendy followed me out of the shop and to the right. I couldn&#x2019;t stop them, not that I wanted to. If I was right, they deserved to see it.</p><p>And there it was, plastered on the stucco wall that separated Paisley Printing from the third shop in the row, the Farmers&#x2019; Natural Market, a pricey, overly quaint food store. Gracing the wall space&#x2014;as recently as an hour ago&#x2014;had been two side-by-side paintings, both done in an old-fashioned style, brightly colored and reminiscent of fruit crate labels. The first announced the presence of &#x201c;Fresh Baked PIES&#x201d; while the second celebrated the shop&#x2019;s &#x201c;Fair Trade COFFEES.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Freakish mystery solved,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>At the moment, the coffee painting was completely obscured by Peter and Wendy&#x2019;s newly printed hip ad. I had to hand it to Luther; it was a perfect fit. It covered the coffee ad perfectly. And the letters, with a nearly identical font, lined up with those of the pie painting next to it. &#x201c;Not cool,&#x201d; said Peter, staring at it and tugging at his stubble. &#x201c;Who would do this?&#x201d;</p><p>The &#x201c;this&#x201d; in question was the following:</p><p>FRESH</p><p>BAKED</p><p>HIP PIES</p><p>CAUSING YOU PAIN?</p><p>The bold red arrow pointed directly to the Paisley Printing storefront. &#x201c;Fresh baked hippies.&#x201d; I moaned as I read.</p><p>&#x201c;It was Adrian, wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; said Wendy. &#x201c;Why would he . . . I know he has his issues going on. But I thought he at least respected us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t Adrian,&#x201d; I stammered. &#x201c;I mean, it was. Obviously. But he doesn&#x2019;t do practical jokes. Clyde, your African-American dude? His name is Luther and he&#x2019;s Adrian&#x2019;s friend. Luther must have been the force behind it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is kind of funny,&#x201d; Peter admitted, getting over his initial shock. &#x201c;We worked so hard making it just right. And the whole point was to prank us with our own work. Good job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go talk to the market people. I&#x2019;m sure they can peel it off without harming the wall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s totally harmless and peelable and biodegradable,&#x201d; said Peter. &#x201c;The dude paid extra to make sure.&#x201d; He stretched to his full height, grabbed the top two corners and slowly pulled down the fake hip ad. It came off in one piece, and he just stood there, holding it, staring at it, his eyes drooping at the edges. &#x201c;We like to take pride in our work, you know? Make the client happy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they were happy,&#x201d; I said lamely.</p><p>A few minutes and several more apologies later, I was back in my office, at my desk, on the phone, doing my best to yell at Luther Washington. Or should I say Clyde?</p><p>&#x201c;It was Mr. Monk&#x2019;s idea,&#x201d; he said smoothly, refusing to raise his voice in response. &#x201c;I acted as the facilitator, you might say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That is so not true. I know Adrian a lot better than you do. He would never even think of pulling a prank like that. He can be unthinking and self-centered and a dozen other things. But the man is not cruel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, maybe I did go proactive,&#x201d; Luther admitted. &#x201c;But I had to do something to stop his whining about the hippies. I figured he needed to feel some control over the situation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And hurting their feelings made him feel in control?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, the poster was his brainstorm. He went through the whole morning smiling and focused and not worried about a thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know. That&#x2019;s how he gets when he&#x2019;s in the middle of a case. But a case is a lot more productive than insulting a couple of sweet people we have to work next door to every day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So we punked the hippies. Big deal.&#x201d; Luther lowered his voice to a growl. &#x201c;We all got our ways of dealing with Mr. Monk. You use your psychology and I use mine. It&#x2019;s as simple as that.&#x201d;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t as simple as that. Being a caretaker for Monk is a delicate proposition. In the past I never had to worry about some stranger coming in and leading our little genius astray. For one thing, it takes a rare character to put up with him. For another, Monk has a moral compass of magnetized iron. He won&#x2019;t even warn me about a lurking patrol car on a freeway when I&#x2019;m going a few miles over the speed limit. &#x201c;Yes, I saw him, but I&#x2019;m not a radar detector,&#x201d; he would say as the officer would be busy writing me a ticket on the side of the road. &#x201c;That would have been cheating.&#x201d;</p><p>But there are always gray areas, chinks in Monk&#x2019;s armor. One of those chinks is his need for friendship. Luther is Monk&#x2019;s employee and has a vested interest in at least pretending to be a friend. And Luther, I was discovering, had ways of working outside the box.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know which happened first&#x2014;Luther hanging up on me or Daniela Grace walking through the door. Let&#x2019;s say they happened at about the same time. &#x201c;Daniela,&#x201d; I said, putting down my phone and breaking into a big smile. &#x201c;Good to see you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get too excited, dear. I don&#x2019;t come bearing a new case.&#x201d;</p><p>Daniela is a senior partner in a white-shoe law firm, although with her, the preppy white oxfords had been replaced by black Manolo Blahnik heels. She was skirting the upper reaches of middle age, thin and stylish and reminiscent of my mother. It takes a village to keep these women looking so spectacular.</p><p>I tried to hide my disappointment. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to have a case to come and visit. It&#x2019;s always a pleasure. Do you want some tea?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, thanks. Just a quick question.&#x201d; She stood in the doorway as if expecting me to get up and go over to greet her&#x2014;which I did, of course. &#x201c;The last time I was here, I noticed that printing company next door. Have you ever availed yourself of their services?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, as a matter of fact.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t know why I say half the things I do. &#x201c;Just availed ourselves this morning. They did a project for Adrian.&#x201d; I was telling the truth. And I suppose I was feeling a little guilty and sorry.</p><p>&#x201c;Was Adrian happy with their work?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Happy?&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;He was practically giddy.&#x201d;</p><p>Despite the years of expertly injected Botox, Daniela managed to raise her eyebrows. &#x201c;High praise indeed. My firm is putting together a series of IPO documents for one of our clients. All very hush-hush. We would do it in-house, but frankly our people get paid too much by the hour and don&#x2019;t have the time. You say these printers do high-quality work? Are they reliable?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very reliable and great quality. They did a color match on a sign that was incredible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; said Daniela. &#x201c;Personal recommendations are always the best.&#x201d; She took a step out the door and examined the hanging sign. &#x201c;Paisley Printing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re good people,&#x201d; I insisted. &#x201c;They won&#x2019;t overcharge and they seem very careful and honest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Done,&#x201d; said Daniela, and made a right turn out the door without ever coming fully inside. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll say you recommended them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please do,&#x201d; I called out after her, then turned back to face my empty office.</p><p>At least someone was getting a job today.<br><br><b>CHAPTER TWO</b></p><p>It turns out we got a job, too. Peter and Wendy might have considered this the result of my good karma, but only if they ignored Monk and Luther&#x2019;s bad karma.</p><p>Less than five minutes after Daniela went over to introduce herself, my phone rang. It was Captain Stottlemeyer with a consulting gig. We hadn&#x2019;t had a police case in months, not since that infamous triple homicide in that warehouse on Stockton Street. I guess that&#x2019;s the curse of specializing in weird, unsolved murders and living in a relatively safe city.</p><p>Once or twice during this dry spell we&#x2019;d run into the captain. But neither of us had seen Lieutenant Amy Devlin in ages. She...</p></p><h2>Shapesville</h2><p>Shapesville is a picture book about five friends who live in a small town. They are all different shapes, sizes, and colors, and each has an unique talent. They encourage children to celebrate their own differences and learn that, "It&#x2019;s not the size of your shape, or the shape of your size, but the size of your heart, and that deserves first prize. So be proud of your body, any size or shape will do. Be proude of your body because YOU are a STAR too!" Discussion questions and brief information for educators and parents are in the back of the book.</p><p>Remarkably, the three co-authors are recent graduates from small Kenyon College in Gambier, OH, where they wrote Shapesville as an independent study project. Finding a publisher for their book defied millions to one odds! Andy Mills and Becky Osborn received their B.A. degrees in Psychology, and Erica Neitz, the illustator, graduated with a B.A. in Art. All of them will be actively marketing the book.</p><h2>The Kitchen Readings: Untold Stories of Hunter S.

Do not attempt them at home.</p></p><p><p>Michael Cleverly is an Aspen-area artist. He has been a columnist for the <em>Aspen Times Weekly</em> since 2000. Both Michael and Bob were close friends of Hunter in Woody Creek.</p><br><br><p>Bob Braudis has been the sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado, since 1986. Both Michael and Bob were close friends of Hunter in Woody Creek.</p>According to the couple of old Woody Creek buddies of Hunter S. Thompson's (aka Doc) who compiled this ramshackle selection of anecdotes about the gonzo practitioner, the kitchen at Doc's was the favored place for conversation since the living room had devolved into a squalid, fetid, pigsty. Thompson's legend as a fire-breathing, vituperative hellion had spread far and wide&#x2014;due in no small part to his own self-promotion of it&#x2014;but many old-time residents of the Colorado mountain town where he holed up for several decades were fiercely protective of their resident hell-raiser. That attitude is clearly represented by this book's pair of authors, an artist and a sheriff, who relate numerous tales of paranoid and wanton destruction (often involving cocaine, firearms and too many glasses of Chivas) with the same indulgence one reserves for a dangerously eccentric relative. The book keeps the stargazing to a minimum and mostly presents Thompson the man&#x2014;one who was fortunate he could write because he comes off here as pretty useless at day-to-day life. The authors recount everything from Thompson's invention of shotgun golf to the reason he needed all those peacocks around. While Cleverly and Braudis try to puncture the media myth of Thompson the Indestructible (on his aborted attempt at covering Vietnam, they sardonically note that he seemed to only like danger when he was the most dangerous person in the room), it's a gentle ribbing; we should all have friends as generous and forgiving as Thompson clearly did. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Between George Lucas's <i>American Graffiti</i> in 1973 and Richard Linklater's <i>Dazed and Confused</i> twenty years later, lust-driven laugh riots on the order of <i>Animal House</i>, <i>Porky's</i>, <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>, and <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i> boomed at the box office and conquered pop culture by celebrating adolescent misbehavior run amok.<p> Puberty-powered comedy classics including <i>Meatballs</i>, <i>Caddyshack</i>, <i>Valley Girl</i>, and <i>The Last American Virgin</i> fused hormonal overloads with anti-authority abandon and below-the-belt slapstick to create a genre that also unleashed the anarchic, sex-mad likes of <i>The Swinging Cheerleaders</i>, <i>H.O.T.S.</i>, <i>Hardbodies</i>, <i>Private School</i>, <i>Joysticks</i>, <i>Spring Break</i>, and <i>Zapped!</i>--as well as the mainstream variations <i>Sixteen Candles</i>, <i>The Breakfast Club</i>, <i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</i>, and <i>Pretty in Pink</i>.</p><p> All-seeing author Mike "McBeardo" McPadden (<i>Heavy Metal Movies</i>) passes righteous judgment over the entire genre, one boobs-and-boner opus at a time.

In <i>Life on Land,</i> she interweaves the story of her Brooklyn childhood and discovery of dance with the psychic and physical collapse that led to the development of Continuum, her groundbreaking movement and self-realization technique. Readable, poignant, and ultimately triumphant, the book melds Conrad&#x2019;s unique theories of the body-mind frontier with fearless discussions of Jewish heritage, sexuality, female identity, and social pressures.</p><p>Emilie Conrad, the founder of Continuum, was born and raised in New York City where she studied ballet and Afro-Haitian dance. After moving to Los Angeles in 1963, she began teaching at the Actors Studio, where her novel approach to movement helped performing artists and led to her choreographing and directing numerous plays and performance works. In 1974, Conrad pioneered a protocol for spinal cord injury, and from 1974 to 1979 she was Movement Specialist in a research study conducted by Dr. Valerie Hunt at UCLA. This groundbreaking study demonstrated that fluid, primary movement is essential in our ability to innovate. Enhancing these fundamental movements has a potential to create a rich intrinsic environment that brings forth new insights in our understanding of the human body and its potential to create alternate systems.Considered a visionary in movement education, Conrad&#x2019;s inspiring work has been incorporated by an international audience of professionals from fields such as Rolfing, Zero balancing, Hellerwork, Craniosacral therapy, Osteopathy, physical therapy, dance, Psychoneuroimmunology, and physical fitness.

In their private world, the Rockefellers have created extraordinary gardens. Over the course of a century, their grounds have matured and evolved to reflect the layered visions of three generations of the Rockefeller family. At Kykuit in the Hudson Valley, John D. Rockefeller valued broad expanses of lawns with a noble forest of evergreens at the perimeter. His son&#x2014;John D. Rockefeller Jr.&#x2014;molded this landscape into a more formal Beaux-Arts garden design. This garden was later enhanced by Nelson A. Rockefeller&#x2019;s addition of an extensive collection of twentieth-century sculpture, which is still in place today.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>The Rockefeller Family Gardens</i>,<b> </b>photographer Larry Lederman gives readers unprecedented access to the two Kykuit gardens&#x2014;the expansive Beaux-Arts&#x2013;style garden and a little-known Japanese garden, brought to life by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. This book also takes readers inside the garden at Eyrie, the family summer retreat in Seal Harbor, Maine. There, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller collaborated with noted designer Beatrix Farrand to design a walled garden inspired by Asian aesthetics at the perimeter and filled with traditional perennials. <br> &nbsp;<br> Lederman&#x2019;s photographs capture the beauty of these gardens in all seasons, focusing on the geometry of the designs and the color and light that animates them. This tour through the spaces is accompanied by text from Todd Forrest of the New York Botanical Garden, Cassie Banning of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Garden, and Cynthia Bronson Altman of Kykuit to provide commentary on the design and plant materials featured in this captivating collection of photos.</p><p>Larry Lederman has been photographing landscapes for the past fifteen years.

A crop of atheist manifestos led the charge, surmounting and holding the tops of the nonfiction bestseller lists. This offensive brought on an outpouring of religious rebuttals. As both sides exchanged spirited volleys, accusations were leveled; myths, stereotypes, and strawmen arguments were perpetuated; and bitter hostility filled the air. Today many of these misconceptions and myths linger on, along with the generally acrimonious spirit of the debate. In <i>America&#x2019;s Blessings</i>, distinguished researcher Rodney Stark seeks to clear the air of this hostility and debunk many of the debate&#x2019;s most widely perpetuated misconceptions by drawing from an expansive pool of sociological findings. Looking at the measurable effects of religious faith and practice on American society, Stark rises above the fray and focuses exclusively on facts. His findings may surprise many, atheists and believers alike. Starting with a historical overview, Stark traces America&#x2019;s religious roots from the founding of the country up through the present day, showing that religiosity in America has never been consistent, static, or monolithic. Interestingly, he finds that religious practice is now more prevalent than ever in America, despite any claims to the contrary. From here, Stark devotes whole chapters to unpacking the latest research on how religion affects different facets of modern American life, including crime, family life, sexuality, mental and physical health, sophistication, charity, and overall prosperity. The cumulative effect is that when translated into comparisons with western European nations, the United States comes out on top again and again. Thanks in no small part to America&#x2019;s rich religious culture, the nation has far lower crime rates, much higher levels of charitable giving, better health, stronger marriages, and less suicide, to note only a few of the benefits. &nbsp;In the final chapter, Stark assesses the financial impact of these religious realities. It turns out that belief benefits the American economy&#x2014;and all 300 million citizens, believer and nonbeliever alike&#x2014;by a conservative estimate of $2.6 trillion a year. Despite the atheist outcry against religion, the remarkable conclusion is clear: all Americans, from the most religious among us to our secular neighbors, really ought to count our blessings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Rodney Stark is one of the leading authorities on the sociology of religion. For many years, the Pulitzer Prize nominee was professor of sociology and professor of comparative religion at the University of Washington. In 2004 he became Distinguished Professor of the Social Sciences and codirector of the Institute for Studies of Religion at Baylor University. He has authored more than 150 scholarly articles and 32 books, including several widely used sociology textbooks and best-selling titles like <i>The Triumph of Christianity: How the Jesus Movement Became the World&#x2019;s Largest Religion, God&#x2019;s Battalions: The Case for the Crusades, </i>and <i>The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success. </i><br></p><h2>Corinth 1862: Siege, Battle, Occupation (Modern War Studies)</h2><p><strong>Fletcher Pratt Award <br><br>McLemore Prize</strong><br><br>In the spring of 1862, there was no more important place in the western Confederacy&#x2014;perhaps in all the South&#x2014;than the tiny town of Corinth, Mississippi.<br><br>Major General Henry W. Halleck, commander of Union forces in the Western Theater, reported to Washington that "Richmond and Corinth are now the great strategical points of war, and our success at these points should be insured at all hazards." In the same vein, Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard declared to Richmond that "If defeated at Corinth, we lose the Mississippi Valley and probably our cause." Those were odd sentiments concerning a town scarcely a decade old. By this time, however, it sat at the junction of the South's two most important rail lines and had become a major strategic locale. <br><br>Despite its significance, Corinth has received comparatively little attention from Civil War historians and has been largely overshadowed by events at Shiloh, Antietam, and Perryville. Timothy Smith's panoramic and vividly detailed new look at Corinth corrects that neglect, focusing on the nearly year-long campaign that opened the way to Vicksburg and presaged the Confederacy's defeat in the West.<br><br>Combining big-picture strategic and operational analysis with ground-level views, Smith covers the spring siege, the vicious attacks and counterattacks of the October battle, and the subsequent occupation. He has drawn extensively on hundreds of eyewitness accounts to capture the sights, sounds, and smells of battle and highlight the command decisions of Halleck, Beauregard, Ulysses S. Grant, Sterling Price, William S. Rosecrans, and Earl Van Dorn.<br><br>This is also the first in-depth examination of Corinth following the creation of a new National Park Service center located at the site. Weaving together an immensely compelling tale that places the reader in the midst of war's maelstrom, it substantially revises and enlarges our understanding of Corinth and its crucial importance in the Civil War.</p><p>Timothy B. Smith is author of a half dozen books, including <i>Mississippi in the Civil War: The Homefront</i>; <i>Champion Hill: Decisive Battle for Vicksburg</i>; and <i>The Untold Story of Shiloh: The Battle and the Battlefield</i>. He currently teaches at the University of Tennessee at Martin."<i>Corinth 1862: Siege, Battle, Occupation</i> is a great read and is a must for the Civil War enthusiast."--<b><i>Military Review</i></b><p>"This is an outstanding battle narrative, and it goes beyond the fighting. . . . Smith's book is an excellent commemoration of Civil War Corinth and a worthwhile addition to any Civil War library."--<i><b>Blue &amp; Gray Magazine</b></i></p><p>"Smith is successful in presenting this comprehensive study of the political and military importance of Corinth during the first three years of the war, as well as of the civil affairs of Corinth throughout the War. . . . This is an excellent military and social history that fills a gap in our Civil War knowledge of the Western theater in the period between the Battle of Shiloh and the fall of Vicksburg. It will both entertain and inform you, and I highly recommend it to you."--<b><i>Tennessee Valley Civil War Roundtable Newsletter</i></b></p><p>"A noteworthy accomplishment. It has broken new ground on a long ignored aspect of the war. The information on the movement to, the operations around, and occupation of Corinth by Union forces should excite the interest of any Civil War enthusiast. This is a must have volume, especially those who are particularly interested in the western theater of operations."--<b><i>TOCWOC - A Civil War Blog</i></b></p><p>"Corinth 1862 is a terribly important and original contribution to the Civil War literature. . . .

He teaches literature at Bard and lives in Manhattan.</p>Memory trumps life and existence acquires the hue of old hand-tinted photographs in this collection of 14 essays by a self-defined perennial expatriate. Aciman, a frequent contributor to the New Yorker and the New York Review of Books, grew up in Egypt, Italy and France, and lives in Manhattan. Taking up again the themes of Out of Egypt, his acclaimed memoir of his family's lost life in Alexandria, he fumbles for the nebulous essence of a rootless existence. On a return trip to Alexandria, he tentatively visits old apartment buildings, the Graeco-Roman Museum and the Jewish cemetery, each site leached of visceral impact and replotted on an abstract, internal map. In Paris, a trip to the Square Lamartine in the 16th arrondissement calls to mind the few winter weeks he spent in the city when he was 14. Straus Park, a small, neglected and magically marginal triangle of ground on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, comes to symbolize all the cities he has ever known and loved. Farther afield, he visits Proust's hometown of Illiers, touring the Proust Museum just a few days before Christmas with a select group of Proust enthusiasts, and travels to Bethlehem, where the tension among Muslims, Christians and Jews reminds him of Alexandria. A final few pieces explore the patterns of love affairs in New York: bus routes remembered, cafes revisited, sentiments examined. Aciman makes an art of indirection. He travels, he ruefully explains, "not so as to experience anything at the time of my tour, but to plot the itinerary of a possible return trip. This, it occurs to me, is also how I live." So long as he keeps from slipping into a repetitive, rarified exaltation of displacement, such insights illuminate the most shadowy corners of memory and motivation.

Though it was a small, poor country, England for most of those "hundred years" won the battles, sacked the towns and castles, and dominated the war. The protagonists of the Hundred Years War are among the most colorful in European history: <b>Edward III, the Black Prince</b>; <b>Henry V</b>, who was later immortalized by Shakespeare; the splendid but inept <b>John II</b>, who died a prisoner in London; <b>Charles V</b>, who very nearly overcame England; and the enigmatic <b>Charles VII</b>, who at last drove the English out. <b>Desmond Seward</b>'s critically-acclaimed account of the Hundred Years War brings to life all of the intrigue, beauty, and royal to-the-death-fighting of that legendary century-long conflict.</p><p><b>Desmond Seward</b> was born in Paris and educated at Cambridge University.

In a tour de force that could be described as Altmanesque, we are invited into the private lives of the residents of a quiet urban street in England over the course of a single day. In delicate, intricately observed closeup, we witness the hopes, fears, and unspoken despairs of a diverse community: the man with painfully scarred hands who tried in vain to save his wife from a burning house and who must now care for his young daughter alone; a group of young clubgoers just home from an all-night rave, sweetly high and mulling over vague dreams; the nervous young man at number 18 who collects weird urban junk and is haunted by the specter of unrequited love. The tranquillity of the street is shattered at day&#39;s end when a terrible accident occurs. This tragedy and an utterly surprising twist provide the momentum for the book. But it is the author&#39;s exquisite rendering of the ordinary, the everyday, that gives this novel its freshness, its sense of beauty, wonder, and hope. Rarely does a writer appear with so much music and poetry -- so much vision -- that he can make the world seem new.</p><p>Jon McGregor published his first novel in Britain in 2002 to critical acclaim, and was inspired in part by the phenomenal media attention that surrounded the death of Princess Diana.

And the song sings the loudest when <br>you pick out each<br>note.<br><br>The low soothing hum of air-conditioners, fanning out the heat and the smells <br>of shops and cafes and offices across the city, winding up and winding down, <br>long breaths layered upon each other, a lullaby hum for tired streets.<br>The rush of traffic still cutting across flyovers, even in the dark hours a <br>constant crush of sound, tyres rolling across tarmac and engines rumbling, <br>loose drains and manhole covers clack-clacking like cast-iron castanets.<br>Road-menders mending, choosing the hours of least interruption, rupturing <br>the cold night air with drills and jack-hammers and pneumatic pumps, hard-<br>sweating beneath the fizzing hiss of floodlights, shouting to each other like <br>drummers in rock bands calling out rhythms, pasting new skin on the veins of <br>the city.<br>Restless machines in workshops and factories with endless shifts, turning <br>and pumping and steaming and sparking, pressing and rolling and weaving <br>and printing, the hard crash and ring and clatter lifting out of echo-high <br>buildings and sifting into the night, an unaudited product beside the paper <br>and cloth and steel and bread, the packed and the bound and the made.<br>Lorries reversing, right round the arc of industrial parks, it seems every lorry <br>in town is reversing, backing through gateways, easing up ramps, shrill-<br>calling their presence while forklift trucks gas and prang around them, <br>heaping and stacking and loading.<br>And all the alarms, calling for help, each district and quarter, each street and <br>estate, each every way you turn has alarms going off, coming on, going off, <br>coming on, a hammered ring like a lightning drum-roll, like a mesmeric bell-<br>toll, the false and the real as loud as each other, crying their needs to the <br>night like an understaffed orphanage, babies waawaa-ing in darkened wards.<br>Sung sirens, sliding through the streets, streaking blue light from distress to <br>distress, the slow wail weaving urgency through the darkest of the dark <br>hours, a lament lifted high, held above the rooftops and fading away, lifted <br>high, flashing past, fading away.<br><br>And all these things sing constant, the machines and the sirens, the cars <br>blurting hey and rumbling all headlong, the hoots and the shouts and the <br>hums and the crackles, all come together and rouse like a choir, sinking and <br>rising with the turn of the wind, the counter and solo, the harmony humming <br>expecting more voices.<br><br>So listen.<br>Listen, and there is more to hear.<br>The rattle of a dustbin lid knocked to the floor.<br>The scrawl and scratch of two hackle-raised cats.<br>The sudden thundercrash of bottles emptied into crates. The slam-slam of <br>car doors, the changing of gears, the hobbled clip-clop of a slow walk home.<br>The rippled roll of shutters pulled down on late-night cafes, a crackled voice <br>crying street names for taxis, a loud scream that lingers and cracks into <br>laughter, a bang that might just be an old car backfiring, a callbox calling out <br>for an answer, a treeful of birds tricked into morning, a whistle and a shout <br>and a broken glass, a blare of soft music and a blam of hard beats, a barking <br>and yelling and singing and crying and it all swells up all the rumbles and <br>crashes and bangings and slams, all the noise and the rush and the non-stop <br>wonder of the song of the city you can hear if you listen the song<br><br>and it stops<br><br>in some rare and sacred dead time, sandwiched between the late sleepers <br>and the early risers, there is a miracle of silence.<br><br>Everything has stopped.<br><br>And silence drops down from out of the night, into this city, the briefest of <br>silences, like a falter between heartbeats, like a darkness between blinks. <br>Secretly, there is always this moment, an unexpected pause, a hesitation as <br>one day is left behind and a new one begins.<br>A catch of breath as gasometer lungs begin slow exhalations.<br>A ring of tinnitus as thermostats interrupt air-conditioning fans.<br>These moments are there, always, but they are rarely noticed and they rarely <br>last longer than a flicker of thought.<br>We are in that moment now, there is silence and the whole city is still.<br><br>The old tall-windowed mills, staggered across the skyline, they are silent, <br>they are keeping their ghosts and their thoughts to themselves.<br>The smoked-glass offices, slung low to the ground, they are still, they are <br>blankly reflecting the haze and shine of the night. Soon, they will resume <br>their business, their coy whispers of ones and zeroes across networks of <br>threaded glass, but now, for a moment, they are hushed.<br>The buses in the depot, waiting for a new day, they are quiet, their metalwork <br>easing and shrinking into place, settling and cooling after eighteen hours of <br>heat and noise, eighteen hours of criss-crossing the city like wool on a loom.<br>And the clubs in the centre, they are empty, the dance-floors sticky and sore <br>from a night"s pounding, the lights still turning and blinking, lost shoes and <br>wallets and keys gathered in heaps.<br>And the night-fishers strung out along the canal, feeling the sing of their lines <br>in the water, although they are within yards of each other they are saying <br>nothing, watching luminous floats hang in the night like bottled fireflies, <br>waiting for the dip and strike which will bring a centre to their time here, <br>waiting for the quietness and calm they have come here to find.<br>Even the traffic scattered through these streets: the taxis and the cleaners, <br>the shift-workers and the delivery drivers, even they are held still in this <br>moment, trapped by traffic lights which synchronise red as the system <br>cycles from old day to new, hundreds of feet resting on accelerators, <br>hundreds of pairs of eyes hanging on the lights, all waiting for the amber, all <br>waiting for the green.<br><br>The whole city has stopped.<br><br>And this is a pause worth savouring, because the world will soon be <br>complicated again.<br><br>It"s the briefest of pauses, with not time enough to even turn full circle and <br>look at all the lights this city throws out to the sky, and it"s a pause which is <br>easily broken. A slamming door, a car alarm, a thin drift of music from half a <br>mile away, and already the city is moving on, already tomorrow is here.<br><br>The music is coming from a curryhouse near the football ground, careering <br>out of speakers placed outside to attract extra custom. The restaurant is <br>almost empty, a bhindi masala in one corner, a special korma in the other, <br>and the carpark is deserted except for a young couple standing with their <br>arms around each other"s waists. They"ve not been a couple long, a few days <br>perhaps, or a week, and they are both still excited and nervous with desire <br>and possibility. They"ve come here to dance, drawn sideways from their route <br>home by the music and by bravado, and now they are hesitating, unsure of <br>how to begin, unfamiliar with the steps, embarrassed.<br><br>But they do begin, and as the first smudges of light seep into the sky from <br>the east, from the far side of the city and in towards these streets, they hold <br>their heads high and their backs straight and step together in time to the <br>slide and wheel of the music. They dance with a style more suited to the <br>ballroom than to the bollywood movies the music comes from, but they <br>dance all the same, hips swinging, waists touching, eyes fixed on eyes. The <br>waiters have come across to the window, they are laughing, they are calling <br>uncle uncle to the man in the kitchen who is finally beginning to clean up <br>after a long night. They dance, and he steps out of the door to watch, wiping <br>his hands on his apron, licking the weary tips of his fingers, pulling at his <br>long beard. They dance, and he smiles and nods and thinks of his wife <br>sleeping at home, and thinks of when they were young and might still have <br>done something like this.<br><br>Elsewhere, across the city, the day is beginning with a rush and a shout, the <br>fast whine of office hoovers, the locked slam of lorry doors, the hurried <br>clocking on of the early shifts.<br><br>But here, as the dawn sneaks up on the last day of summer, and as a man <br>with tired hands watches a young couple dance in the carpark of his <br>restaurant, there are only these: sparkling eyes, smudged lipstick, fading <br>starlight, the crunching of feet on gravel, laughter, and a slow walk home.<br><br>Copyright � 2002 by Jon McGregor.

This new systematic conception and presentation of the evidence differs in three ways from Hermann Diels&#x2019;s groundbreaking work, as well as from later editions: it renders explicit the material&#x2019;s thematic organization; it includes a selection from such related bodies of evidence as archaic poetry, classical drama, and the Hippocratic corpus; and it presents an overview of the reception of these thinkers until the end of antiquity.</p><p> Volume I contains introductory and reference materials essential for using all other parts of the edition. Volumes II&#x2013;III include chapters on ancient doxography, background, and the Ionians from Pherecydes to Heraclitus. Volumes IV&#x2013;V present western Greek thinkers from the Pythagoreans to Hippo. Volumes VI&#x2013;VII comprise later philosophical systems and their aftermath in the fifth and early fourth centuries. Volumes VIII&#x2013;IX present fifth-century reflections on language, rhetoric, ethics, and politics (the so-called sophists and Socrates) and conclude with an appendix on philosophy and philosophers in Greek drama.</p></p><p><p>Andr� Laks is Professor Emeritus of Ancient Philosophy at the University of Paris&#x2013;Sorbonne, and Professor of Ancient Philosophy at the Universidad Panamericana, Mexico City.</p><p>Glenn W.

And spending a few months doing so gives the reader almost all that she needs (perhaps along with Loeb #258, <i>Greek Elegiac Poetry</i>) to reconstruct for herself the origins of the discipline of philosophy.

Somewhere down the road there had to be payback for her perfect child-<p>&nbsp;</p><p>hood, her perfect career at the veterinary clinic, her perfect apartment in Minneapolis, her consistently perfect life. Friends who adored her envied her in equal measure, and secretly waited for the tragedy to come, because they believed in the law of averages and the irrefutable balance of good and bad in every life. And also because in the darkest moments of their own less than perfect lives, they just had to believe that someday Marla would get hers.</p><p>&#x201c;Good things come to good people,&#x201d; her father was fond of tell- ing her on those rare occasions when the shower of her good fortune made her feel just a little bit guilty. But if that were really true, why did the rest of the world believe the opposite? The notion that good- ness was punished was so pervasive that even the language was per- meated with warnings. Only the good die young. Nice guys finish last. No good deed goes unpunished. Phrases like that had often&nbsp;given Marla pause; made her think she should try harder to do some- thing bad occasionally, like forget to return a library book, just to even out the scales.</p><p></p><p></p><p>And then she&#x2019;d run over the bunny.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop crying, Marla. And stop calling it a bunny.It was just a goddamn rabbit.&#x201d; Her father had tried to comfort her with seman- tics.&#x201d; Probably the same one that ate every lick of my spinach plants last week. Every last lick.&#x201d;</p><p>But he hadn&#x2019;t known the worst of it, because she could never bring herself to say it aloud. The bunny hadn&#x2019;t died right away. She&#x2019;d seen it in her rearview mirror, trying to drag itself off the road with its front legs, because the hind legs wouldn&#x2019;t work. She&#x2019;d had to go back and run over it again.</p><p>It had been the right thing to do; but oh my God, that image in her rearview mirror would be with her to the end of her life, and although her father had felt great sympathy for her distress, he hadn&#x2019;t felt a bit for the rabbit. How could that be? How could you feel sorry for someone for being sad and not feel sorry for something being dead?</p><p>She spent the next week imagining that the bunny had been a nursing mother, and that somewhere baby bunnies were cold and mewling in a hidey-hole, slowly dying of starvation. She never admit- ted that to anyone, because people tended to think you were a bit unbalanced when you empathized with animals to the point of tor- ment. But empathy was the disease Marla had inherited from her mother, and there were no boundaries to it. She couldn&#x2019;t help con- necting to everyone and everything she encountered; she couldn&#x2019;t stop speculating about their lives, their families, their pain&#x2014;even that of silly rabbits that ate her father&#x2019;s entire spinach crop and then ran out in front of a speeding car.</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Normally Marla didn&#x2019;t mind the night drive out to the farm, es- pecially on a Thursday, &nbsp;when the freeway was empty. Tomorrow night the frenetic weekend race to lake cabins would fill the two lanes heading out of Minneapolis with a jam of lights, white and red, crawling bumper-to-bumper for sixty miles before it started to thin out. But tonight, and every other summer weeknight, the road shot straight and true into deeper and deeper blackness where the exits were few and far between. Her exit, just three miles up, was what worried her. That particular two-lane road was one bunny shy this week, thanks to her, and she greatly feared a repeat of last week&#x2019;s carnage.</p><p>She took the ramp more slowly than usual, stopped at the top and spent a long time looking both ways before easing right onto the two-lane road. There was no moon tonight, and the darkness seemed to swallow the beams of her headlights, as if she were shining them down the throat of a monster. &nbsp;She slowed &nbsp;even further as she ap- proached the S curve through the woods where the bunny had once lived, and that was the only reason she didn&#x2019;t run right over the large black shape in the middle of the road.</p><p>As soon as her headlights hit the thing, she recognized it as one of those large plastic bags the volunteer crews used to pick up the occasional litter on road cleanup days. Still, it had startled her, and she could hear her heart pounding in her ears as she pulled over onto the shoulder and stopped. She sat there for a minute trying to catch her breath, her fingers still curled tight around the wheel, eyes wide and fixed on the bag.</p><p><i>Relax, Marla. Blink, for God&#x2019;s sake. It&#x2019;s not an animal, not a per- son; it&#x2019;s just a bag of trash. </i>Normally these bags were carefully placed on the shoulder for the township truck to collect, but this one was smack-dab in the middle of the two-lane road, and a genuine hazard</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>to any vehicle coming around the blind S curve at a normal rate of speed. It never occurred to her to simply drive around it and go on.</p><p>Her mind was already busy imagining a speeding car zipping around the first bend in the curve, slamming on the brakes, veering off the road and plowing head-on into a tree.</p><p>It was only after she got out of the car that she also imagined that same speeding car running into her while she was trying to drag the bag off the road, which made her move a lot faster.</p><p>It was surprisingly heavy, and it made a terrible scraping sound on the pebbly asphalt as she tugged and pulled it by inches toward the shoulder, and that was when she began to suspect what was re- ally in the bag. She released it with a little squeal and a shiver, and backed away.</p><p>Motorists killed more deer on this particular curve than all the hunters in the county managed to bring down during hunting sea- son. You didn&#x2019;t think much about what happened after the accidents unless you happened to see the roadkill crews making their rounds, loading grisly remains into the open-backed truck that hauled them away. Sometimes the job got messy, and then they had to use a shovel and a bag. Apparently this particular bag had fallen unnoticed off the back of the truck when it accelerated on the curve.</p><p>Marla looked down at the bag with a mixture of sadness and distaste, understanding the heaviness now, seeing the telltale swells and lumps that clearly marked a large object and not a collection of discarded cans and paper. At least she hadn&#x2019;t killed this one; hadn&#x2019;t witnessed its violent end, which made the job ahead a little easier. She wondered absently why it didn&#x2019;t smell, murmured a brief prayer that the bag didn&#x2019;t rip when she tried moving it again, then bent to her work.</p><p>This time she put her back to the side of the road and tried pull-</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ing the bag toward her. The large animal inside shifted and rolled with the first tug. Marla winced, but kept at it, right up until the moment the bag snagged on a sharp piece of broken asphalt, tore open, and a bloody human arm fell out.</p><p>Marla snapped upright and stifled a choked &nbsp;gasp. For a minute her mind didn&#x2019;t work at all, and then when it started up again it manufactured terrible pictures. Not that there was a dead person in that bag, because that was a reality she just couldn&#x2019;t accept at the moment. What occurred to her instead was that in the movies, just when the heroine thought she was safe, the supposedly dead per- son&#x2019;s hand jerked out and grabbed her ankle.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh God, oh God, oh God.&#x201d; She began to back very, very care- fully away, toward her car, keeping her eyes focused on the inky blackness of the road ahead, because she didn&#x2019;t dare look down at the bag again.</p><p>And then suddenly, twin white lights pierced the darkness and began rolling toward her, faster and faster. Too small for headlights. They&#x2019;re reverse lights. Dear Jesus, there was &nbsp;a truck up there, so close, and she&#x2019;d never even seen it. And now it was coming for her.</p><p>Marla was totally paralyzed for a few moments, trying to regain her composure, rationalizing for the sake of her sanity, because none of this made sense in her perfect world.</p><p><i>The truck is not coming </i>for <i>you, it&#x2019;s coming to </i>help <i>you. This is the country&#x2014;people stop to offer assistance when they see a car on the side of the road, because in Buttonwillow, &nbsp;Minnesota, everybody is your neighbor, even if you live twenty &nbsp;miles apart. It&#x2019;s probably somebody you know, maybe even somebody you went to grade school with. And there&#x2019;s &nbsp;a perfectly reasonable explanation for that body in the trash bag. . . .</i></p><p>Marla snapped back to reality. No, no, no, there wasn&#x2019;t. There</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>was no perfectly reasonable explanation on God&#x2019;s green Earth for a dead body in a trash bag in the middle of a deserted country road. No perfectly reasonable explanation for this truck, suddenly appear- ing out of nowhere. And now, because she&#x2019;d been thinking too much again, it was too late to duck into the safety of her car and screech away. Too late to call 911 or Jacob, because the truck had rolled to a stop a few feet in front of her car and now the driver&#x2019;s door was slowly creaking open. At that point, she abandoned all thought, suc- cumbed to panic and instinct, and bolted into the woods.</p><p>Every inch of her felt like it was on fire as she leapt through the brush and bramble, dodging trees in the darkness, clambering over fallen logs, &nbsp;tripping &nbsp;over exposed roots &nbsp;and scrambling &nbsp;back to her feet. She knew these woods&#x2014;Cutter Creek was to her right, and a few hundred yards up ahead there was a clearing and then Hank Schifsky&#x2019;s cornfield. Another quarter of a mile up was his long dirt driveway and his old farmhouse. She could make it.</p><p>And then she felt herself falling, felt her ankle give way &nbsp;as she tumbled down a steep, washed-out gully that hadn&#x2019;t existed when she&#x2019;d run wild in these woods as a kid.</p><p>She choked back whimpers of fear and pain and dragged herself to the base of a large oak tree, trying to make herself as small as pos- sible. And as stupid as it was, she hadn&#x2019;t lost hope; she was still wait- ing to hear the call of a friendly voice behind her. &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am? Ma&#x2019;am! Don&#x2019;t run, I&#x2019;m here to help you!&#x201d;</p><p>But all she heard was relentless, crashing footsteps in the woods behind her. The raspy pant of her pursuer.</p><p>Something switched off inside her. She divorced herself from her immediate reality, from her physical being, and retreated deep into the core of her soul. There it was peaceful, a place where she could</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>think of her past and her future. She should have married Jacob. And if he&#x2019;d still have her, she&#x2019;d do just that. They&#x2019;d have babies and live in Buttonwillow until the end of their days. They should have done it a long time ago, back when they were both eighteen and Jacob had given her the promise ring she still wore on her right ring finger, even though she was a grown woman.</p><p>The footsteps were getting closer now, crunching through the dead branches and old, dried leaves that littered the forest floor. Things couldn&#x2019;t end here. She had to leave something so Jacob and her father would know she&#x2019;d been here, had made it this far, and could maybe piece together what had happened if she didn&#x2019;t make it out of these woods alive.</p><p>She pulled the ring off her finger and placed it by the base of the tree where she was hiding, and as she heard the labored breathing getting louder, she got up and started running on her swollen, ru-</p><p>ined ankle, screaming at the top of her lungs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p> he lights were what Walt would always remember. They didn&#x2019;t belong in this dark night in the countryside. They lit up the<p>&nbsp;</p><p>thick woods on the north side of the narrow road, throwing spooky shadows through the tightly packed tree trunks and brush.</p><p>They shed unwelcome light on the north side, where there was a turnaround with space enough for one car to park, for the daring anglers who skidded down the treacherous slope to drop their lines in the creek below. You fished at night during the few weeks when the suckers were running, but for the rest of the summer, only kids parked there at night to kiss and hold hands, and sometimes more than that, before the clock ticked to curfew.</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The turnaround had been there as long as Walt had been alive. He&#x2019;d parked there with Mary, his high school sweetheart, before sneaking &nbsp;back home, and he&#x2019;d proposed to her there, too. Right there, where the path down to the creek carved a hole in a stand of cottonwoods far older than he was now.</p><p>All these things belonged here, had always been here, but not the lights, &nbsp;and yet &nbsp;tonight they were everywhere, &nbsp;startling the early spring frogs into silence, as if the whole place had been swept clean of night creatures.</p><p>Marla&#x2019;s car, the white Ford Explorer he&#x2019;d bought for her when she graduated from college, was sitting in the turnaround, visiting the very spot where she might have been conceived all those years ago. It was spotting from the gentle April rain that had just started to fall, and Walt&#x2019;s eyes brushed over it as if it wasn&#x2019;t there, because it shouldn&#x2019;t be.</p><p>He had been standing here so long while the Highway Patrol set up the lights and county deputies paced the grounds. He was glad the Highway Patrol was here. The more departments, the better. It gave the scene, the tragedy, a level of import that promised careful attention.</p><p>The crime-scene techs, who looked like astronauts in their white suits and booties, hurried to cover that dreadful, bloody place in the middle of the road that was surrounded by blinking red lights and peppered with iridescent yellow crime-scene markers. One of the techs, who had known Walt since he&#x2019;d worked for him baling hay as a high schooler, looked over his shoulder at the old man.</p><p>&#x201c;Probably isn&#x2019;t human blood at all,&#x201d; he said with a fake, forced shrug. &#x201c;Raccoon, squirrel, deer more than likely.&#x201d;</p><p>Walt didn&#x2019;t move.

In <em>Concordance</em>, she has created a fresh body of work transmitting vital signals from a variety of archives. &#x201c;Since,&#x201d; a semi-autobiographical prose-poem, opens the collection: concerned with first and last things, meditating on the particular and peculiar affinities between law and poetry, it ranges from the Permian time of Pangea through Rembrandt and Dickinson to the dire present. &#x201c;Concordance,&#x201d; a collage poem originally published as a Grenfell Press limited edition, springs from slivers of poetry and marginalia, cut from old concordances and facsimile editions of Milton, Swift, Herbert, Browning, Dickinson, Coleridge, and Yeats, as well as from various field guides to birds, rocks, and trees: the collages&#x2019; &#x201c;rotating prisms&#x201d; form the heart of the book. The final poem, &#x201c;Space Permitting,&#x201d; is collaged from drafts and notes Thoreau sent to Emerson and Margaret Fuller's friends and family in Concord while on a mission to recover her remains from the shipwreck on Fire Island. The fierce ethic of salvage in these three very different pieces expresses the vitalism in words, sounds, syllables, the telepathic spirit of all things singing into air.</p><p>Susan Howe has won the Bollingen Prize, the Frost Medal, and the Griffin Award.

The only information the doctor shares with his patient is his name: Innokenty Petrovich Platonov. As memories slowly resurface, Innokenty begins to build a vivid picture of his former life as a young man in Russia in the early twentieth century, living through the turbulence of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. But soon, only one question remains: how can he remember the start of the twentieth century, when the pills by his bedside were made in 1999? Reminiscent of the great works of twentieth-century Russian literature, with nods to Dostoevsky&#x2019;s Crime and Punishment and Bulgakov&#x2019;s The White Guard, The Aviator cements Vodolazkin&#x2019;s position as the rising star of Russia&#x2019;s literary scene.</p><p>Eugene Vodolazkin was born in Kiev and has worked in the department of Old Russian Literature at Pushkin House since 1990.

In this compelling book, he reflects on how Christians have often found it difficult to proclaim God's good news to every realm of society, while those who have needed it most have frequently deemed themselves unworthy due to social circumstances or sinfulness. In <i>Reading the Bible with the Damned</i>, Ekblad offers concrete advice on how to bridge this gap through a variety of insights ultimately leading to spiritual transformation. This book is full of examples of how Scripture changes lives for those who attend Bible studies and for those who lead them, offering practical suggestions on many passages from the Old and New Testaments.</p></p><p>"This book by Ekblad ...moves the Bible away from safe, conventional church venues and reads afresh among the alienated and marginalized. The effect of such a new interpretive context is that the text takes on a poignancy and sharpness that bespeaks the stirring of God&#x2019;s spirit. We may be led by Ekblad to read the Bible yet again, as if for the first time." --Walter Brueggemann, Professor Emeritus, Columbia Theological Seminary, and author of several Westminster John Knox Press books, including <i>An Introduction to the Old Testament: The Canon and Christian Imagination</i> and <i>Reverberations of Faith: A Theological Handbook of Old Testament Themes</i>. <p>"Bob Ekblad is more like Jesus than most people I know...How different the world will be when more of us share Christ&#x2019;s life and heart in the same way.

Inspired by her own traumatic life experiences as an outcast in Apartheid South African society and as a refugee living at the Bamangwato Development Association Farm in Botswana, Head's tough and telling classic work is set in the poverty-stricken village of Golema Mmidi, a haven to exiles. A South African political refugee and an Englishman join forces to revolutionize the villagers' traditional farming methods, but their task is fraught with hazards as the pressures of tradition, opposition from the local chief, and the unrelenting climate threaten to divide and devastate the fragile community.<p> Head's layered, compelling story confronts the complexities of such topics as social and political change, conflict between science and traditional ways, tribalism, the role of traditional African chiefs, religion, race relations, and male female relations.</p><p> <b>Other titles by Bessie Head available from Waveland Press:</b> <i>The Collector of Treasures and Other Botswana Village Tales</i> (ISBN 9781478607601); <i>Maru</i> (ISBN 9781478607618); and <i>A Question of Power</i> (ISBN 9781478634690).</p><p> <b>Other titles by African writers from Waveland Press:</b></p><p> Amadi, <i>The Concubine</i> (ISBN 9781478634607)</p><p> Andreas, <i>The Purple Violet of Oshaantu</i> (ISBN 9781478634584)</p><p> Ba, <i>So Long a Letter</i> (ISBN 9781577668060)</p><p> Campbell, <i>My Children Have Faces</i> (ISBN 13 9781478635017)</p><p> Kubuitsile, <i>The Scattering</i> (ISBN 9781478634591)</p><p> La Guma, <i>In the Fog of the Seasons' End</i> (ISBN 9781478600251)</p><p> Marechera, <i>The House of Hunger</i> (ISBN 9781478604730)</p><p> Nwapa, <i>Efuru</i> (ISBN 9781478611011)</p><p> p'Bitek, <i>Song of Lawino &amp; Song of Ocol</i> (ISBN 9781478604723)</p><p> Plaatje, <i>Mhudi</i> (ISBN 9781478609575)</p><p> Rifaat, <i>Distant Views of a Minaret and Other Short Stories</i> (ISBN 9781478611288)</p></p><p>Bessie Head, one of Africa&#39;s best known writers, was born in South Africa but spent much of her life in Botswana.

It was a gloomy space, buried deep in the city&#x2019;s ancient gatehouse. Jaffa?dan?Iln, as Grand Justice, was the nominal host of the gathering, and he&#x2019;d done his best to straighten up, removing decades of accumulated rubbish, packs of cards, dice, and misplaced papers. There was no way to hide the marks and patches on the carpets, though, nor the plain sandstone walls, devoid of decoration except where some bored Justice had carved them with a belt knife. The table was cheap wood, layered with stains, and the chairs were a mismatched set dragged from every room of the gatehouse. Jaffa had rearranged the bookcases and other furniture to at least conceal the more obscene bits of graffiti.</p><p>The chime of a bell on the stairs heralded the arrival of the first visitor. General Khtoba entered the room cautiously, as though advancing on an enemy position. He wore his uniform?dun trousers and jacket over a white undershirt, the jacket fringed with gold at the shoulders as befitted his rank. A crimson triangle, open on top like a squat V, had been hastily sewn over his heart to represent the fires of the Redemption. At his side was a sword so filigreed with gold and silver that it sparkled as he moved. Behind him came two other officers of the Auxiliaries, similarly uniformed but less impressively accoutred.</p><p>The general looked over the room with barely concealed distaste, selected the least tatty chair, and sat, offering Jaffa only a grunt of recognition. His officers took seats flanking him, as though they expected trouble.</p><p>&#x201c;Welcome, General,&#x201d; Jaffa said. &#x201c;Would you care for any refreshment?&#x201d;</p><p>The general scowled. He had a face made for scowls, with bushy eyebrows and lips shadowed by a broad, drooping mustache. When he spoke, gold gleamed on his teeth.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I would care to get this over with. Where are the damned priests?&#x201d;</p><p>The bell downstairs rang again, as if to answer this minor blasphemy. There was the sound of a considerable party on the steps, and then the priests of the Seraphic Council entered, all in a gaggle.</p><p>Jaffa had grown up knowing what a priest looked like?either an old man, bearded and fat, in gaudy green and purple robes, or else a woman demurely shrouded in silks. This new kind, these hard?eyed young men in spare black wraps, made him uncomfortable. There were no women among their number, demure or otherwise. Their leader was a younger man with close?cropped hair and a scar under one eye, who took a seat at the table opposite the general. His flock remained standing behind him.</p><p>&#x201c;I am Yatchik?dan?Rahksa,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Appointed by the Divine Hand to lead the Swords of Heaven and oversee the final cleansing of foreign taint from our land.&#x201d;</p><p>The name meant &#x201c;Angel of Victory,&#x201d; which Jaffa supposed was appropriate enough. The Divine Hand himself had started the fashion for taking the names of angels when he&#x2019;d called himself Vale?dan?Rahksa, the Angel of Vengeance. At the rate the Council was expanding, there would soon be a serious shortage of angels. Jaffa wondered what would happen when they ran out of manly, intimidating names and were reduced to naming themselves after the Angel of Sisterly Affection or the Angel of Small Crafts.</p><p>Khtoba bristled. &#x201c;That cleansing should have begun weeks ago. The cursed Vordanai were like a fruit in our hands, ripe for the plucking, but they were permitted to escape. Now the task of evicting them will cost many of the faithful their lives.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The truly faithful are always prepared to lay down their lives for the Redemption,&#x201d; the priest said. &#x201c;But I think you overestimate the difficulty, General.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Overestimate?&#x201d; Khtoba frowned. &#x201c;Perhaps you&#x2019;d like to try scaling the walls of Sarhatep without the help of my guns, then.&#x201d;</p><p>Yatchik smiled beatifically. &#x201c;Walls are no obstacle to the will of Heaven.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So the servants of Heaven have discovered how to fly?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sirs,&#x201d; Jaffa said. &#x201c;Before we begin, I should remind you that our council is not yet complete.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, of course,&#x201d; the general drawled. &#x201c;Let us wait to see what a bunch of boy?fucking horse thieves have to say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The gods value all their children,&#x201d; Yatchik said. &#x201c;And glory comes to all who serve the Redemption.&#x201d;</p><p>The bell rang a third time before Khtoba could respond. The last member of the council made no noise on the stairs, and entered the chamber with only the slightest whisper of silk. He was dressed in black from head to foot, loose?fitting robes cinched at the waist, wrists, and ankles in the Desoltai style, with a black silk scarf wound around his head. His face was invisible behind his famous mask, a simple oval of brushed steel with two square holes for eyes.</p><p>This was Malik?dan?Belial, the Steel Ghost, chieftain of the desert tribes. He had risen to prominence long before the beginning of the Redemption. The Ghost&#x2019;s Desoltai raiders had been a thorn in the side of the prince and the Vordanai for years, and the Ghost himself was the hero of a hundred stories told in hushed whispers. It was said that he had no face, only an inky void behind the steel mask, and that he&#x2019;d traded his very identity to a demon for the ability to see the future.</p><p>No one rose as he entered, so it fell to Jaffa to greet him. He got up from his seat and bowed.</p><p>&#x201c;Malik,&#x201d; Jaffa said. The Ghost had never claimed another name or title. &#x201c;Welcome. Please, take your seat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, welcome,&#x201d; said Yatchik. &#x201c;We were discussing plans for the final destruction of the Vordanai. Perhaps you might care to add your opinion?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is too late,&#x201d; said the Ghost. His voice rasped like silk over steel, harsh with the heavy accent of the desert. &#x201c;The raschem fleet has arrived, with transports and ships of war.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard nothing of this,&#x201d; Khtoba said. &#x201c;Where did you get this information?&#x201d;</p><p>The Ghost fixed the general with his blank, faceless gaze. &#x201c;The ships came into sight yesterday evening.&#x201d;</p><p>Khtoba sat tight?lipped. The Steel Ghost had always displayed a remarkable ability to know more than he should. It was just possible that a man on a fast horse, with a string of remounts, could have covered the hundred miles between Sarhatep and the city along the coast road, but Khtoba&#x2019;s own men had undoubtedly been watching that road and presumably they&#x2019;d seen nothing. That meant either that some Desoltai messenger had accomplished the same feat cross?country, over the scrubland and desert of the Lesser Desol, or that the Steel Ghost really did have some magic at his command.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need to confirm that,&#x201d; the general said. &#x201c;If what you say is true, my couriers should bring the news by tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Even still,&#x201d; Yatchik said, &#x201c;we know nothing of their intentions. They may mean to take the prudent course and return to their own lands.&#x201d;</p><p>Khtoba bared his teeth. &#x201c;In which case we&#x2019;ve lost our chance for vengeance on the foreigners and their Exopterai dogs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That the Redemption is accomplished is enough,&#x201d; said the priest. &#x201c;We need spill no more blood than necessary.&#x201d;</p><p>Jaffa had seen the charnel pits in the great square in front of the Palace. Presumably, Yatchik would say that <i>those </i> deaths had been necessary.</p><p>&#x201c;They will not leave our shores,&#x201d; the Ghost said. General and holy man both turned to look at him. &#x201c;The transports are unloading. Men, guns, stores in great quantity.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How many men?&#x201d; Khtoba snapped, his earlier reluctance to accept the Desoltai&#x2019;s information forgotten.</p><p>&#x201c;Three thousand, perhaps four.&#x201d;</p><p>The general snorted. &#x201c;What can they hope to accomplish with so small a force? Can they be mad enough to believe they will defeat the Redemption? My Auxiliaries alone outnumber them.&#x201d;</p><p>The Ghost shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps they mean to simply hold Sarhatep,&#x201d; Yatchik said. &#x201c;If so, they are welcome to it. There is nothing of value so far down the coast.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They cannot be allowed to retain a foothold,&#x201d; Khtoba said. &#x201c;We must soak the sand in Vordanai blood and pack a ship full of their heads to send back to their king. He must understand the folly of sending armies against us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then,&#x201d; Yatchik said, soft as a snake, &#x201c;will you march against them?&#x201d;</p><p>Khtoba froze. Jaffa saw the trap. The general was more afraid of the priests than of the foreigners. If he marched his strength away from the city and weakened himself in battle, there was no guarantee he would find a friendly welcome on his return.</p><p>&#x201c;My friends,&#x201d; Jaffa said, &#x201c;the city is restless. Not all have accepted the Redemption. It may be that the raschem will simply wait, and if they do I suggest that we do the same.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Khtoba. &#x201c;My men are needed to keep order.&#x201d;</p><p>In truth, the drunken soldiers of the Auxiliaries were more of a detriment to public order than a help in keeping the peace, but Jaffa knew better than to say so. Yatchik smiled.</p><p>&#x201c;In that case, General, you are in accord with my own views.&#x201d;</p><p>Khtoba grunted, conceding the point. Jaffa turned to the Ghost.</p><p>&#x201c;Can we rely on you to keep us informed as to the foreigners&#x2019; movements?&#x201d;</p><p>Malik?dan?Belial inclined his masked head slightly. &#x201c;However,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I do not believe they will stay at Sarhatep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; said the general, anxious to be done with this council.</p><p>&#x201c;Among the thousands, there is one who possesses true power. An <i>abh?naathem</i>. Such people do not cross the oceans to no purpose.&#x201d;</p><p>Khtoba snorted. &#x201c;So the Vordanai have sent us a wizard, then? We&#x2019;ll see if his spells make him proof against cannonballs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The power of the gods will overcome any <i>raschem </i> magic,&#x201d; Yatchik said. &#x201c;Those who trust in the Redemption need have no fear of spells or demons.&#x201d;</p><p>The Ghost only shrugged again.</p><p><br>Stripped of his painted cloak and staff of office, the Grand Justice passed into the slums of Ashe?Katarion as the sun sank toward the horizon. He wore the garb of a common trader, a plain brown wrap belted with a rope, and a heavy cudgel swung from his hip.</p><p>There were parts of the city to which the writ of the prince&#x2019;s Justices had never extended, except in name, and this was one of them. Once there had been an informal accord between those who enforced the law and those who flouted it. The criminals kept their operations quiet and orderly, and made certain that the bodies found floating down the river never belonged to anyone wealthy or important. In return, the Justices turned a blind eye to their activities.</p><p>That peace had gone by the board with the coming of the Redemption, along with all the other unwritten rules that made the ancient city work. Some of the slums had practically emptied as the desperate poor flocked to the Redeemers&#x2019; banners. Others had become armed camps, with raids and counterraids leaving corpses that lay in the street for days, to be torn by packs of feral dogs.</p><p>Jaffa therefore kept one hand on his cudgel, and shot hard looks at the unwashed children who watched him from doors and alleyways. The few adults he saw were hurrying along, eyes down, intent on their own errands. This slum, known for reasons understood only by historians as the Hanging Garden, was one of those that had seen the greatest concentration of Redeemer fervor. The dwellings of those who had left to follow the holy flame had been rapidly colonized by the city&#x2019;s enormous population of vagrant youths, always in search of someplace to sleep where they wouldn&#x2019;t be bothered by thieves, pimps, or Justices.</p><p>Along with the squatters had come others who wished to hide from Ashe?Katarion&#x2019;s new rulers. Jaffa turned off the main street, a hard?packed dirt road pocked with occasional half?buried paving stones, and into a narrow alley. This ran on for some time, twisting and turning, and eventually opened out into an irregular courtyard.</p><p>Here, some of Ashe?Katarion&#x2019;s ancient architecture had survived the attentions of the years and the insatiable demand for cut stone. A broad fountain stood in the center, dusty dry now, watched over by a weathered stone god with arms spread in an attitude of benediction. Erosion had blurred his features until he was unrecognizable. Uneven flagstones still floored the rest of the yard, with hard, wiry grass pushing up through the cracks between them.</p><p>It was here, in this hidden yard, that the last true servants of the gods waited. Jaffa approached the wicker chair set beside the fountain and fell to his knees, head lowered.</p><p>&#x201c;Welcome, child.&#x201d; The figure in the chair was cloaked and hooded, despite the spring heat, and her hands were swathed in white bandages. Her voice was desiccated, cracked and dry, like the very voice of the desert.</p><p>&#x201c;Holy Mother,&#x201d; Jaffa said, keeping his eyes on the broken flagstones, &#x201c;I have news from the council.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You bring more than news, it seems.&#x201d; There was a dusty sound from the cloaked woman that might have been a laugh. &#x201c;Onvidaer, bring me our guest.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a startled squeak from behind Jaffa, and the shuffling of sandals. The Grand Justice remained in his attitude of obeisance, sweat beading on his face. &#x201c;I am sorry beyond words, Mother. I did not think?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rise, child,&#x201d; the cloaked woman said. &#x201c;No harm has been done. Now let us see what fish our net has caught.&#x201d;</p><p>Jaffa got to his feet and turned, weak with relief. Standing behind him was a young woman of fifteen or sixteen, scrawny and stick?limbed. Her skin was smudged with the filth of the slums, and she wore only torn trousers and a dirty vest. Her hair hung in thick, greasy clumps.</p><p>Onvidaer had one hand on the girl&#x2019;s upper arm, holding her still without apparent effort. He was a young man, only a few years older than his prisoner, but lean and well muscled, with the copper?gray skin of the Desoltai. He wore nothing but a loincloth, showing broad shoulders and a muscular chest to good effect, and his face was round, almost cherubic. His other hand held a thin?bladed dagger.</p><p>&#x201c;She followed Jaffa,&#x201d; he announced. &#x201c;For some time before he came here. But she has reported to no one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Such a ragged little alley cat,&#x201d; rasped the woman in the chair. &#x201c;But what house does she belong to, I wonder?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one,&#x201d; the girl said. Her eyes were full of defiance. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve done nothing, I swear it. I never followed him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now, now,&#x201d; the woman said. &#x201c;Cool your anger. Were I in your position, I might do better to beg for mercy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know who you are, or . . . or anything!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We will find out the truth of that, soon enough.&#x201d; The hood turned. &#x201c;Summon Akataer.&#x201d;</p><p>A huge shadow detached itself from the wall behind the old woman, resolving into an enormous, hairless man in leather breeches and straps. He gave an assenting grunt and wandered out through the rear of the square, where empty doorways gaped into long?deserted apartments.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, child,&#x201d; the old woman said. &#x201c;Who sent you here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one sent me!&#x201d; she said, jerking at Onvidaer&#x2019;s grip. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m not a child.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All men are children of the gods,&#x201d; the old woman said, not unkindly. &#x201c;And all women, too, even little alley cats. The gods cherish all their children.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Downward Dogs and Warriors: Wisdom Tales for Modern Yogis</h2><p><p>Downward Dogs and Warriors expounds the rich oral tradition of India's mythological stories with the yoga postures that evolved from them.

Health inspectors called the neighborhood &#x201c;the suicide ward.&#x201d; Diarrhea epidemics raged each summer, killing thousands of children. Sweatshop babies with smallpox and typhus dozed in garment heaps destined for fashionable shops. Desperate mothers paced the streets to soothe their feverish children and white mourning cloths hung from every building. A third of the children living there died before their fifth birthday.<br><br>By 1911, the child death rate had fallen sharply and <i>The New York Times</i> hailed the city as the healthiest on earth. In this witty and highly personal autobiography, public health crusader Dr. S. Josephine Baker explains how this transformation was achieved. By the time she retired in 1923, Baker was famous worldwide for saving the lives of 90,000 children. The programs she developed, many still in use today, have saved the lives of millions more. She fought for women&#x2019;s suffrage, toured Russia in the 1930s, and captured &#x201c;Typhoid&#x201d; Mary Mallon, twice. She was also an astute observer of her times, and <i>Fighting for Life</i> is one of the most honest, compassionate memoirs of American medicine ever written.</p><p><b>Sara Josephine Baker</b> (1873&#x2013;1945) was born in Poughkeepsie, New York, and attended the Woman&#x2019;s Medical College of the New York Infirmary. As the first director of New York&#x2019;s Bureau of Child Hygiene from 1908 to 1923, Baker&#x2019;s work with poor mothers and children in the immigrant communities of New York City dramatically reduced maternal and child mortality and became a model for cities across the country. On two occasions she helped to track down Mary Mallon, the cook who came to be known as Typhoid Mary. Baker wrote fifty journal articles and more than two hundred pieces for the popular press about preventive medicine, as well as six books: <i>Healthy Babies</i>, <i>Healthy Mothers</i>, <i>Healthy Children</i> (all 1920), <i>The Growing Child</i> (1923), <i>Child Hygiene</i> (1925), and her autobiography, <i>Fighting for Life</i> (1939). In the 1930s Baker, along with her partner of many years, the novelist Ida Wylie, and their friend Dr. Louise Pearce, moved to a two-hundred-year-old farm in New Jersey, where she lived until her death.<br><br><b>Helen Epstein</b> is a writer specializing in public health and an adjunct professor at Bard College. She has advised numerous organizations, including the United States Agency for International Development, the World Bank, Human Rights Watch, and UNICEF. She is the author of <i>The Invisible Cure: Why We Are Losing the Fight Against AIDS in Africa</i> and has contributed articles to many publications, including <i>The New York Review of Books</i> and <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>.&#x201c;Baker was the first director of a children&#x2019;s public health agency, and the first woman to get a doctorate in public health. She tangled repeatedly with Typhoid Mary. More important, her ideas saved thousands of lives and permanently changed the focus and mission of public health. Her just-reissued 1939 autobiography proves to be one of those magical books that reaches effortlessly through time, as engaging and as thought-provoking as if it were written now.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Dr. Baker shines not only for her contributions to public health and social policy, but also for her work as a woman in government administration, supervising a staff that included many male physicians. Her work made her a leading figure in public health and the New York City Bureau of Child Hygiene became a model for similar programs in other cities, as well as for the United States Children&#x2019;s Bureau.&#x201d; &#x2014;U.S. National Library of Medicine<br><br>&#x201c;Rather than spending her time swanning about town, Josephine Baker became a pioneer, dedicating her life to the field of preventive health care for children.&#x201d; &#x2014;Anthony Bourdain</p><h2>Living Originally: Ten Spiritual Practices to Transform Your Life</h2><p>We see the world not as it is but as we are.<br><br>In Living Originally, Robert Brumet explores how most of our perceived problems stem not from the world, but from a false sense of self. Living originally is the art of knowing the truth about who you are. Using the book s 10 spiritual practices, you can rediscover your origin your true self. As you master the practices, you will be transformed from a false sense of self, defined by your needs and the strategies to fulfill them, into a higher consciousness. As you live from the truth of who you are, everything in your world naturally falls into harmony.</p><p>Robert Brumet is the author of the widely read books Birthing a Greater Reality, Finding Yourself in Transition, and The Quest for Wholeness. He is an ordained Unity<br>minister and teaches courses in pastoral counseling, meditation, and spiritual development at Unity Institute� and Seminary in Unity Village, Missouri.</p><h2>Deeper Than Words: Living the Apostles&#39; Creed</h2><p><b>Spiritual teacher and bridge-builder Brother David Steindl-Rast translates the Apostles' Creed for today, uncovering the deeper universal truths that can be an inspiration to all people.</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>In <i>Deeper than Words: Living the Apostles&#x2019; Creed</i>, Brother David reexamines the words with which the early followers of Jesus summarized their faith. Reading line-by-line with an open perspective, he reveals the often overlooked message of trust, compassion, peace, love, and awareness contained in this widely known but rarely examined statement. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Deeper than Words</i> moves beyond ritual and exclusivity and instead finds a deeper faith based in real human experience and the sense of limitless belonging that is shared by all people who seek to understand themselves and the world. The words of the Apostles' Creed are Christian, but its heart is a universal and timeless guide to fullness of life. From this transformation perspective, developed over a lifetime of contemplation, Brother David presents a powerful call to renewal through reconnection with the spiritual and a reawakening to shared sacred truths.</p><p><b>BROTHER DAVID STEINDL-RAST</b> (b. 1926) was born in Austria and came to the United States after receiving his Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of Vienna. As a member of the Benedictine Order of Catholic monks, he is known for pioneering work in interfaith dialog, especially between Christianity and Buddhism, for his promotion of the spiritual practice of gratefulness, and for his efforts to revitalize contemplative prayer life. For decades, Brother David has divided his time between periods of hermit's life and extensive lecture and retreat tours on five continents. He is author of numerous books, including the classics of spirituality <i>Gratefulness, the Heart of Prayer</i> and <i>A Listening Heart</i>, and he is the co-founder of A Network for Grateful Living, an organization dedicated to gratefulness as a transformative influence for individuals and society.

The single word credo is translated by two English words, i believe. We shall take a closer look at the Latin word in the next section. Here we focuson the meaning of the "I" that speaks in the Creed. Who is that "I"?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Only when they are joined together in the phrase i believe do these two words reveal their full meaning. They define each other, as it were. When the "I" that speaks here "believes," this means infinitely more than accepting an unproven proposition aslikely; it is rather an expression of unconditional trust. Only when we know that this is what believing means can we understand which "I" is speaking here; and only this "I," in turn, can believe, in the full sense of believing. Only an "I" brave enough forthe radical confidence of unconditional trust can be our true Self. Our little ego--which we often mean when we say "I"--is incapable of the courageous trust of faith. Why? Because the opposite of faith as trust is not doubt but fearfulness, and our ego thriveson fear. The ego owes its very existence to the illusion of being separated from the whole--little me against the rest of the world. No wonder it feels isolated, insecure, and threatened. Our true Self is securely embedded in the whole of being. What couldit possibly fear? It trusts.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>By saying I BELIEVE, giving both words of this phrase their full weight, we blow the sham of the ego to pieces and enter into an altogether new reality. We give expression to what it means to be fully human.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Let me express this in a somewhat whimsical image: Little X enters a little church--all perfectly harmless and uneventful. But then comes the time to recite the Creed, and Little X says, "i believe." Suddenly--for eyes focused on a deeper reality--roofand steeple of the church fly off, the walls crumble, time and space are suspended. All that is left is the one, all-embracing human Self in the eternal Now.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The Creed speaks in the language of the Christian religion, but also in the voice of a spirituality that lies deeper than any particular tradition. The I that says "i believe" is our true Self, the one authentic Self all humans have in common.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>How do we know this is so?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"Know thyself!" reads the inscription above the entrance to Apollo's temple at Delphi, site of the famous oracle. But the ancient Greeks were not alone in this admonition of the key to wisdom. Any human being who reaches a certain stage of awareness isconfronted with the challenge of self-knowledge. And as soon as we embark on the journey of self-exploration, we discover the distinction between the self we observe and a bigger Self that does the observing. We need not elaborate here on the implications.Reliable guidance to self-knowledge is readily available today, say, in the books of Eckhard Tolle or through Gempo Roshi's Big Mind Process. In our context here, we need only pay attention to two facts:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> 1. Self-observation shows us how deeply we are entangled in what we have called the ego. We can't even stop our own thoughts or the torrent of stories by which the ego keeps up the illusion of being an independent entity. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. The more we learn to live in the now, the more we will discover the Self. As simple a practice as being alert to the opportunity each moment offers us--opportunity to breathe, to enjoy, to learn--will make us more and more at home in that Self whichis one with all. There we experience no fear and can smile at the efforts of the ego to perpetuate itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Greek statues typically have a support leg and a free leg. Beginners in self-awareness stand with their support leg firmly in their ego consciousness. The goal of spiritual training is to shift our weight until the center of gravity rests in the true Self--ourBuddha nature, as Buddhists would say; other traditions use other expressions. Saint Paul writes, "I live, yet no longer I, but Christ lives in me" (Galatians 2:20). <br><br>Try to feel your way inside toward that core of yourself where you are the Watcher who is notyour thoughts but can watch them. This going-inward unveils your Self to yourself--your Christself. The more we identify with this reality, the more we become uniquely ourselves and, at the same time, one with all others. Only this Self can "believe" in thefull sense; only our true Self can trust unconditionally.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>This is the reason that the Creed, although it is a community's declaration, does not begin with the word we but with I. This quintessential human Self--Purusha in Hindu mythology, IItoi (the Man in the Maze) in the myths of the Tohono O'Odham in Arizona,the Cosmic Christ, to give but three of many names--speaks in me and through me, because this is who I truly am.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Why make such a point of this?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>If we understand the first two words of the Creed correctly, we know what "believing" means and which "I" is speaking here. This turns out to show that the Creed is not what most people think it is. Usually it is taken to be a proclamation of beliefs bywhich Christians distinguish themselves from all others. Rightly understood, however, it is the expression of a faith shared by all who find and acknowledge their true Self--and there is no other faith. What people call different faiths are merely differentbelief systems, different expressions of the one universal attitude of existential faith. Far from affirming differences between "us" and "the others," the Creed takes the sting out of these distinctions. It proclaims, in the language and imagery of the Christiantradition, a faith that is common to all human beings. Its very first word stands for that Self to which all spiritual traditions point the way.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Every one of these traditions is, as it were, a different door leading to the same sanctuary. The more we find the way to this inner sacred space and become at home there, the more freely will we be able to go in and out through the different doors. Wewill no longer be blocked by what seems strange to us, nor will we cling to what is familiar. Common Sense tells us how vital such an understanding is in a world still torn by wars of religion. There are still people who apparently think that one can becomea better Christian at the expense of being fully human--truly humane. Anyone who puts Christian ideology above the concern for human beings could serve as an example for this incorrect understanding. Thus, what could be more urgent than to realize that theChristian profession of faith makes full humanness its cornerstone? &nbsp; Since it is the quintessential human who speaks in the Creed, we will apply this insight to the text as a whole and find what each of its statements means in universal terms. Actually, if you just said i believe, and really knew what you meant by it, allthat the Creed spells out would be summed up in that one phrase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Personal reflections&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Nothing is more difficult than to believe--truly to believe--in the love of another human being. Nothing is more natural than love, yet nothing is more unbelievable. That your friend loves you goes without saying, yet, for that very reason, saying so mustultimately remain unconvincing. More is needed. But what is this "more"? It is the trust--the faith--that must be supplied by the one who receives love.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>My first experience of all this started as a childhood game, a staring contest with my cousin. We invented this game (or rather reinvented it, as every new generation does, I am convinced) as we lay there on a red-and-white checkered blanket on the lawn,bored and a bit resentful for still having to take an afternoon nap even though we felt so grown-up by now. It started as a contest about who could look longer into the other's eyes. Turn away and you lose. But suddenly it turned into more than a game. Maybethis began by seeing our own image mirrored small and dark in the other's pupil. What happened after that cannot easily be put into words. Somehow, we fell into each other's eyes. Like children in a fairy tale who fall into a magic pool, we were now in an enchantedland. Here one could be two and yet be one. When our eyes began to water, both of us closed them at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Later we tried to laugh it all off, but deep down we knew that we had glimpsed the real world. At that level of intense awareness, all is love. Seeing is love, breathing is love, being is love--love as a belonging that cannot be questioned or doubted. &nbsp; Decades later I read the line by E. E. Cummings "i am through you so i," and I remembered. In retrospect I could recognize what the experience shared with my cousin had been: an encounter with God. Only a great poet can sum up so succinctly the insight--theconviction--that flows from an encounter like that. "i am through you so i." The you must be there for the I to find itself. Trust in you gives me trust in myself. In the encounter between the you and the I, faith is born. I am so truly I because I have faithin you. Only the I that comes about through faith can have faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>And you? When and how have you encountered that paradox? Don't look in your memory for some big external event. For you, too, a playful moment in childhood may have provided that flash of insight never forgotten, often neglected, eminently worth recovering.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I Believe in God&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>What does this really mean?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>This initial statement contains, as in a seed, the whole of the Creed. It means that I dedicate myself in complete trust to a power greater than myself. This dedication is a commitment of my whole being--mind and body--from my heart, my innermost being,my "deep heart's core" to use an expression coined by William Butler Yeats.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Faith is far more than the sum total of beliefs. Beliefs are merely pointers; faith is profound trust in the actuality to which beliefs point. The Creed mentions beliefs, but it is a statement of faith, not of beliefs. There are many beliefs, but thereis ultimately only one faith: faith in God. Beliefs are only so many windows toward the one actuality with which faith is concerned: God.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>In the original Latin, the opening phrase of the Creed i believe is one word, credo, from which the English word creed derives. Credo is a compound of cor ("heart") and do ("I give") and means literally "I give my heart." This is an expression of faith,not of belief. The original connotation of "believing" was not so different from "giving one's heart"; the word has the same linguistic root as love. Today, however, the meaning has completely shifted. By belief, one gives one's intellectual assent; by faith,one gives one's heart, in total trust. And the reference point of such trust is what the word god signifies whenever it is properly used.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>In this initial proclamation of the Creed, the word god is used merely as a pointer. It indicates a direction, the direction of the human heart's ultimate trust. Here god is not yet identified as source and goal of my life, my highest value; its meaningis still waiting to be clothed in images like the famous one by the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins: "Ground of being, and granite of it: past all grasp, God." At this point in the Creed the term "God" refers merely to the goal of an inveterate longing of the humanheart for meaning. The persistence of that feeling, however, implies a deep trust that our longing can and will be stilled. This trust is the most basic faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>How do we know this is so?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> From the time we become conscious as human beings we are aware (no matter how vaguely) of the transcendent. Are you aware that everything you experience becomes in your mind a story? This starts in childhood, as soon as we become conscious. Even if younever tell this story to any person, the fact that it is a story implies a listener who takes an interest in our life story. Although we rarely focus on it, this awareness provides the contrasting background onto which we project whatever else we are awareof. In this sense we implicitly know what is meant by god before we know anything else: the Listener for whom we make a story out of our life.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>But many people have become allergic, as it were, to the word god. This is understandable. Too often the G-word has been misunderstood and misused. In an attempt to point at the experiential reality without pushing the wrong linguistic button, I oftenuse synonyms--"Ultimate Reality," "Ground of Being," "Source of Life," and the like. Yet, when we want to understand the Creed, our task is not to replace the word god with a different one, but rather to deepen our understanding of its meaning, especially themeaning it acquires in the context of professing one's faith.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Abraham Maslow has called attention to what he calls "peak experiences" as decisive for an understanding of religious faith. In our peak moments, we experience existential communion with an ultimate reality that transcends our own limited self. This experienceis so basic that we cannot reasonably doubt its insight. It makes no sense to ask, "Is this real?" because what we encounter here is the reality that sets our standard for all that is real.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>One of the leading psychiatrists of the mid-twentieth century, Maslow set himself the task of finding out what characterizes people whom one would consider models of mental health. To his great surprise he found that the psychologically healthy, highlycreative, and resilient people he examined had one thing in common: mystic moments. They reported experiences in which they felt a sense of limitless belonging and experienced the goodness and beauty of all that exists--very much like the great mystics of thedifferent spiritual traditions. Maslow spoke of "peak experiences" because his colleagues frowned upon the term "mystic," but to the end of his life he insisted that there was no difference between the two. He also found that everyone seems to have these experiences--tothe extent to which one is allowed to generalize. What distinguishes truly great human beings from ordinary people is that they let their lives be shaped by their mystic insights. For instance, they behave toward others as one behaves toward people to whomone belongs; they live gratefully aware of the goodness and beauty we encounter everywhere.</p><h2>Moo: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>This uplifting </strong><em><strong>New York Times</strong></em><strong> bestseller reminds us that if we&#x2019;re open to new experiences, life is full of surprises.</strong></p><p>Fans of Newbery Medal winner Sharon Creech&#x2019;s <em>Love That Dog </em>and <em>Hate That Cat</em> will love her newest tween novel, <em>Moo</em>.

A moving, often comic portrait of wise child Ann August and her mother, Adele, a larger-than-life American dreamer, the novel follows the two women as they travel through the landscape of their often conflicting ambitions. A brilliant exploration of the perennial urge to keep moving, even at the risk of profound disorientation, <i>Anywhere But Here</i> is a story about the things we do for love, and a powerful study of familial bonds.</p><p>"Strangers always love my mother," Ann August tells us at the start of <i>Anywhere But Here</i>. "And even if you hate her, can't stand her, even if she's ruining your life, there's something about her, some romance, some power. She's absolutely herself. No matter how hard you try, you'll never get to her. And when she dies, the world will be flat, too simple, reasonable, fair." Indeed, over the course of the dozen or so years chronicled in Mona Simpson's first novel, Ann and everyone else related to the charming, delusional Adele learn this the hard way. Ann does hate her at times; Adele does indeed come pretty close to ruining Ann's life on numerous occasions, or at least scarring it, and yet, ultimately, it isn't possible not to love her. As Ann puts it: "The thing about my mother and me is that when we get along we're just the same."<p> This is a woman who uproots her child from Wisconsin and moves to Los Angeles, leaving behind a dull husband (not Ann's father--who wandered off long ago but makes appearances here in memories), under the premise that life will be beautiful and Ann will become a famous television star. But her lifelong dream and goal ("It was our secret, a nighttime whispered promise" turns out, like so many things in the Augusts' lives, to be lackluster when it becomes reality. Adele merely feeds on fantasy and drags her daughter along. </p><p> Nevertheless, it's hard not to worship her. We hear from her mother, her sister, from Ann, and finally from Adele herself, and no matter how she's used people, what trouble she's gotten into, or what lies she's told--and there are plenty of all three--a certain amount of awe always remains. When we come upon Ann's proclamation that "it's always the people like my mother, who start the noise and bang things, who make you feel the worst; they are the ones who get your love." It's startling to realize how heartily we agree with her. <i>Anywhere But Here</i> gives truth to this statement in a way that few books ever have. It's dense with misery and amazement all tangled together--a realistic and thus rare portrait of love. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Anywhere But Here is a moving, often comic portrait of wise child Ann August and her mother, Adele, a larger-than-life American dreamer. As they travel through the landscape of their often conflicting ambitions, Ann and Adele bring to life a novel that is a brilliant exploration of the perennial urge to keep moving, even at the risk of profound disorientation. Simpson's first novel is ultimately a heart-rendering tale of a mother and daughter's invaluable relationship. <br>"The two women in this book are American originals. Ann is a new Huck Finn, a tough, funny, resourceful love of a girl. Adele is like no one I've encountered, at once deplorable and admirable--and altogether believable."<br>--Walker Percy <br>"Anywhere But Here is a wonder: big, complex, masterfully written, it's an achievement that lands [Simpson] in the front ranks of our best novelists."<br>--"Newsweek</p><h2>Trout</h2><p><i>Trout</i> is arguably the finest single volume ever produced on how, why, and where to catch trout.

Walters examines the difficulties and inequities that women still face, more than forty years after the "new wave" of 1960s feminism--difficulties, particularly, in combining domesticity, motherhood and work outside the home. How much have women's lives really changed? In the West, women still come up against the "glass ceiling" at work, with most earning considerably less than their male counterparts. What are we to make of the now commonplace insistence that feminism deprives men of their rights and dignities? And how does one tackle the issue of female emancipation in different cultural and economic environments--in, for example, Islam, Hinduism, the Middle East, Africa, and the Indian sub-continent?<br></p><p><br><strong>Margaret Walters</strong> is a freelance writer and reviewer.

Studebaker and his brothers in the nineteenth century, to the family&#x2019;s entry into the automobile industry in 1902, to the last Studebaker automobile to roll off the assembly line in 1966. The book, however, is much more than the story of a family business; it is also, in microcosm, the story of the industrial development of America. The Studebakers had always been industrialists in the sense that they made their living by manufacturing things, albeit on a small scale. When the Industrial Revolution hit the country with full force, spurred on by the Civil War, it transformed America from a rural-agrarian society into an urban-industrial one. The fortunes of the Studebaker family were transformed with it. As the title suggests, the Studebaker story was mostly one of success. Studebaker wagons and carriages were long noted for their quality and popularity, and so, too, were Studebaker automobiles. The 1953 Starliner and the 1963 Avanti, designed under Raymond Loewy&#x2019;s direction, are widely regarded as among the most innovative examples of American industrial design. The book deals in detail with the soaring prosperity of the company in the 1920s, the bankruptcy and miraculous recovery in the 1930s, the stupendous success of the early post-World War II period, and the eventual decline of the company&#x2019;s fortunes in the mid-1950s. It describes the development of such famous models as the Lark, Avanti, and Gran Tourisimo Hawk, with special attention paid to the Avanti II, a surprisingly successful spinoff from the dying company that continued to be produced until 1991. The final chapter, on why Studebaker died, is tightly reasoned and more convincing than previous theories. Throughout, the author has used personal incident and characterization to bring to life the rich, tumultuous history of one of America&#x2019;s longest enduring industrial empires.</p><p>&#x201c;The result of a prodigious amount of research and admirably organized, this is the fullest and most detailed account of the Studebaker automobile.&#x201d;&#x2014;James A.

Until the 1980s, this scourge killed ten million people every decade, but by early 2000s mass starvation had all but disappeared. Today, famines are resurgent, driven by war, blockade, hostility to humanitarian principles and a volatile global economy.&nbsp;<br><br>In&nbsp;<i>Mass Starvation</i>, world-renowned expert on humanitarian crisis and response Alex de Waal provides an authoritative history of modern famines: their causes, dimensions and why they ended. He analyses starvation as a crime, and breaks new ground in examining forced starvation as an instrument of genocide and war. Refuting the enduring but erroneous view that attributes famine to overpopulation and natural disaster, he shows how political decision or political failing is an essential element in every famine, while the spread of democracy and human rights, and the ending of wars, were major factors in the near-ending of this devastating phenomenon.&nbsp;<br><br>Hard-hitting and deeply informed,&nbsp;<i>Mass Starvation</i>&nbsp;explains why man-made famine and the political decisions that could end it for good must once again become a top priority for the international community.</p></p><p><b>Alex de Waal</b> is Executive Director of the World Peace Foundation and a Research Professor at The Fletcher School, Tuft's University."A scholarly and passionate book.

Yet groups are not a panacea for organizational problems;conflicts between individuals or factions within a group oftencreate seemingly contradictory situations?paradoxes?that canprevent the group from reaching its goals.<br> <br> In this groundbreaking classic, Kenwyn Smith and David Berg offera revolutionary approach to understanding groups and overcoming theproblems that often paralyze group members, the group as a whole,and relations among groups. They explore the hidden dynamics thatcan prevent a group from functioning effectively. And they show howan apparently paradoxical suggestion?for example, inviting asuccess oriented group to risk failure, or affirming the benefitsof going nowhere to a group focused on moving ahead?can breakaction barriers, overcome conflicts, and improve groupperformance.<br> <br> Smith and Berg offer a different way of thinking about groups thatwill open new avenues of inquiry for professors and students ofgroup behavior, and they propose many innovative ideas that willprove valuable to consultants, trainers, therapists, and others whowork with groups on a regular basis.</p><p>Two organization behavior experts examine the contradictory situations that cause conflict within groups and offer a new perspective that helps to overcome the problems that paralyze group members, the group as a whole, and relationships between groups.KENWYN K.

This groundbreaking book uncovers the activism of visionaries--both well-known figures and unsung citizens--from across the ideological spectrum who sought something different from, or more complicated than, "integration." Local activists often played leading roles in carrying out the agenda of the NAACP, but some also pursued goals that differed markedly from those of the venerable civil rights organization. Brown-Nagin documents debates over politics, housing, public accommodations, and schools. Exploring the complex interplay between the local and national, between lawyers and communities, between elites and grassroots, and between middle-class and working-class African Americans, <em>Courage to Dissent</em> transforms our understanding of the Civil Rights era.<br></p><p><br><strong>Tomiko Brown-Nagin</strong> is Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.

Heavily illustrated with photographs by Judy Linn, Robert Mapplethorpe, Edward Maxey, and others, <em>Early Work</em> brings together all sides of Patti Smith, from the thoughtful intellectual to the explosive performer.</p><p>Patti Smith is a poet, performer, visual artist, and author of the National Book Award-winning memoir Just Kids. She has twelve albums, has had numerous gallery shows, and continues to give concerts of her music and poetry. Her books include Early Work, The Coral Sea, Witt, Babel, Auguries of Innocence, Woolgathering, Land 250, Trois, and many others. She lives in New York."An artist wears his work in place of wounds. Here then is a glimpse of the sores of my generation," Smith says in a brief introduction. It is in the context of its decade that readers might best appreciate this volume. The writing from the four books gathered here, which seemed so daring in the 1970s, has lost some of its fury, especially when held up against recent performance artists. But this also works to the book's advantage: readers are not shocked as easily, and those who were caught up in their own turmoils during the 1970s can look more objectively at what Smith has to offer. Her stream-of-consciousness style permits superficial stabs at mystical vision, but beneath the sex, drugs, and four-letter words, she reveals a romantic sensibility. Sometimes, as in a magnificent three-page prose meditation on God and her father, everything calmly falls into place. With photos by Robert Mapplethorpe and Judy Linn.

Why do most animals only get one billion beats? (And how did modern humans get to over two billion-effectively letting us live out two lives?) Why are sufferers of gingivitis more likely to have heart attacks? Why do we often undergo expensive procedures when cheaper ones are just as effective? What do Da Vinci, Mary Shelley, and contemporary Egyptian archaeologists have in common? And what does it really feel like to touch your own heart, or to have someone else's beating inside your chest? <br><br>Rob Dunn's fascinating history of our hearts brings us deep inside the science, history, and stories of the four chambers we depend on most.</p><p>Rob Dunn is a professor in the Department of Applied Ecology at North Carolina State University.

At last we have a realistic way forward.

From Kenya, where teenagers reduced their risk of contracting AIDS by having more unprotected sex with partners their own age, to Mexico, where giving kids a one-dollar deworming pill boosted school attendance better than paying their families to send them, <i>More Than Good Intentions</i> reveals how to invest those billions far more effectively and begin transforming the well-being of the world.</p></p><p><b>Dean Karlan</b> is Professor of Economics at Yale University and president of IPA.

While Gideon does all he can to help, he is tormented by the knowledge that The Tar Man, his nemesis, is also his own brother.

The Gideon Trilogy was inspired by the criminal underworld of eighteenth-century London.The Time Quake TWO<p></p> <p></p> A SPENT ROSE<p></p> <br><i>In which the party struggle to know what to do about Kate&#x2019;s affliction and Gideon brings some promising news</i><br> <br>The hot summer of 1763 was drawing to a close, and there was something in the air, a quality to the light, that made the residents of Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields cherish every last warm evening before the first chill of autumn sent them scurrying indoors. Only a few streets away, amidst the raucous cries of street hawkers and the incessant thunder of wagons, starving children begged, soldiers mutilated in the recent war drowned their sorrows in gin, and for the sake of a few coins footpads beat their victims senseless up dark alleyways. But here in this civilized London square all was calm and comfort and respectability. Who could have guessed that behind these fine facades could be heard the first rumblings of a cataclysmic storm that threatened to destroy all before it?<br> <br>Dusk was approaching, and the trees in the square were thick with songbirds, which trilled and warbled in the rapidly fading light. A blackbird perched sentrylike on a tall wroughtiron gate that graced the frontage of an imposing house to the west of Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields. The sweet birdsong drifted into Sir Richard Picard&#x2019;s first-floor drawing room, carried in on wafts of air made fragrant by the honeysuckle that scrambled beneath the open window. Inside the room were to be found Parson Ledbury and two children from the twenty-first century, although their appearance gave no clue as to the century they called their own&#x2014;except that under closer scrutiny their shoes seemed better suited to a modern-day sports field than the elegance of an eighteenth-century drawing room. Kate Dyer lay stretched out on her belly on a couch beneath the window, her red hair vivid against her sprigged green dress. She supported her chin in one cupped hand, while with the other she tugged absentmindedly at the sleeve of a discarded jacket draped over the back of a chair. The boy it belonged to, Peter Schock, was sitting at a circular table in front of a chessboard. Opposite him, white wig awry, sat a portly man of the cloth, who emptied a glass of claret in one gulp and set it back on the table with a bang that jolted Kate temporarily out of her reverie.<br> <br>In the middle of setting out the chess pieces for a return match with the redoubtable Parson Ledbury, a white knight suspended in midair between finger and thumb, the young Peter Schock glanced over at his friend. Kate&#x2019;s eyelids kept sliding shut, but as soon as they closed she would jerk them open again through sheer effort of will. Another day spent searching for the Tar Man&#x2014;and hopefully the duplicate antigravity machine that Kate&#x2019;s father and the scientist Dr. Pirretti had built&#x2014;had left Peter frustrated and anxious. But Kate was utterly wrung out and exhausted&#x2014;as, it seemed to Peter, she so often was. Gideon and Sir Richard had been keen to continue the search, but when they noticed Kate&#x2019;s white face, they insisted that the Parson take the children home to rest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go to bed, Kate, before we have to carry you up,&#x201d; Peter said.<br> <br>Kate shook herself and pushed herself up. &#x201c;No. I want to see Parson Ledbury thrash you first.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter stuck out his tongue at her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now, if <i>you</i> were to challenge me, Mistress Kate, it would be a different matter entirely.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;I will. Afterward.&#x201d; Kate laughed and slumped back onto the overstuffed sofa, pulling out the flounces of her dress, which were badly spattered, she noticed, with mud and other unmentionable substances from the gutters of Covent Garden. She should really get changed, but not yet ... not just yet. Perhaps when she had rested for a little longer. The familiar, piercing cry of swallows made her turn her head to look through the open window. As her eyes followed the birds swooping and diving through the air in search of midges, she felt a pang of homesickness. How often had she and her brothers and sisters stood in their Derbyshire farmyard and watched swallows build their nests under the eaves. Kate wondered if she would ever do so again but instantly scolded herself for even doubting it. So she forced herself to look out at the dome of St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral, whose silhouette, rising up into the golden evening sky beyond Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields, spoke to her so powerfully of hope. She sighed heavily, and another strand of hair tumbled down over her face.<br> <br>The Parson beat Peter in three moves, but by then Kate was fast asleep, and even the Parson&#x2019;s victory cry did not wake her. The two players looked first at Kate and then at each other.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think Kate likes being alone right now,&#x201d; whispered Peter.<br> <br>&#x201c;I do not think it is a question of her being alone,&#x201d; said the Parson, endeavoring to lower his booming voice a few notches. &#x201c;Rather, it seems to me that Mistress Kate is frightened of being separated from <i>you.</i> Bringing up the rear of the party, I observed her tagging behind you like a lamb to its mother, growing ever more anxious as the crowds grew denser.&#x201d;<br> <br>This was not what Peter wanted to hear. He had noticed it too. A frown etched itself onto his forehead.<br> <br>&#x201c;I saw a few people staring at her today. If she carries on fading at this rate, I think it&#x2019;s going to be really noticeable. She can still get away with it&#x2014;just&#x2014;but not for very much longer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Alas, I am of your opinion, Master Peter. Her condition has worsened since her return to this time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get why it&#x2019;s happening. I&#x2019;ve traveled through time as much as she has. It&#x2019;s not as if she keeps blurring back or anything. ... It&#x2019;s not like the first time. And I haven&#x2019;t blurred back once.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ay, the phenomenon is the queerest thing I ever saw, and I cannot for the life of me account for it. Upon my word how you, Peter, continue to be in rude health while your companion droops and fades like a spent rose is quite beyond my comprehension.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think she&#x2019;ll get better if we get her back home?&#x201d; asked Peter.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am certain of it, my dear boy,&#x201d; said the Parson, unconvincingly. &#x201c;But for her own safety I fear she must soon be restricted to going out under cover of darkness. ...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What! Am I becoming a vampire now?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kate was suddenly fully awake. She shot up from the sofa and stood facing Parson Ledbury accusingly. The Parson stared vacantly back at her.<br> <br>&#x201c;A vampire?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you all planning on putting a stake through my heart or something?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be daft, Kate!&#x201d; exclaimed Peter. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just worried about you, that&#x2019;s all&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I most humbly beg your pardon, Mistress Kate; I thought you were asleep,&#x201d; the Parson said guiltily. &#x201c;To distress you was the last thing in the world I intended&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not fading!&#x201d; Kate practically shouted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m <i>not</i>! I&#x2019;m still me! I&#x2019;m Kate Dyer, and I have five brothers and sisters, and I live on a farm in Derbyshire, and I have a golden Labrador called Molly, and my dad is going to come and get me! You see if he doesn&#x2019;t!&#x201d;<br> <br>Parson Ledbury and Peter exchanged glances. Peter looked at Kate&#x2019;s pale face flushed with emotion, and he expected to see tears rolling down her cheeks, though none came.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am a foolish old man who should have known better. I hope you will forgive me, Mistress Kate,&#x201d; said the Parson.<br> <br>Peter sat down next to Kate on the sofa and slowly put an arm around her shoulders, unsure whether she wanted to be comforted in this way, but Kate immediately clung to Peter and put her face into the crook of his neck. She took hold of his hand and gripped it hard. Peter looked down. Kate&#x2019;s flesh was no longer the same as his own. The effect was subtle but unmistakable. It looked faded and ever so slightly translucent, a little like wax, and if he had not known better, he would have thought there was an invisible layer that insulated his skin from hers. So little warmth radiated from her hand. Peter felt desperate. He badly wanted to help Kate get better, but what could he do?<br> <br>&#x201c;I promise we won&#x2019;t let anything happen to you. We&#x2019;ll&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Kate cut him off mid-sentence. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t. Don&#x2019;t make any promises you can&#x2019;t keep.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I shall fetch Hannah,&#x201d; said the Parson. &#x201c;She will know what to do for the best. Some smelling salts, perhaps, or a drop of brandy. ...&#x201d;<br> <br>Parson Ledbury stepped onto the landing and closed the door behind him. Kate and Peter were left alone and, anxious to break the silence, Peter reached into his pocket and showed Kate a worn and very grubby piece of paper, folded up into a tiny square.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look. Do you remember this? I&#x2019;d forgotten I still had it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; asked Kate, peering at it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not your Christmas homework, is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter smiled and nodded. He unfolded it carefully and read:<br> <br><i>&#x201c;Christmas homework. To be handed in to Mr. Carmichael on January eighth. Write five hundred words on My Ideal Holiday.&#x201d;</i><br> <br>Kate burst out laughing. &#x201c;You showed it to me that first day in Derbyshire. How funny!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If I did it, do you think it&#x2019;d get us home?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d be handing it in really late. ...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah&#x2014;I&#x2019;d probably get a detention. ...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably two. ...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And a hundred lines. <i>I must not time-travel during term-time.</i>&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter put it back in his pocket, and presently they heard voices in the hall and the sound of the front door shutting, and then the click of heels against wood as someone bounded up the stairs.<br> <br>&#x201c;I trust that Mistress Kate fares better,&#x201d; said Sir Richard, striding into the room followed by Parson Ledbury. &#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; he continued, observing her strained, pale face. &#x201c;I see that she does not. ...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I <i>do</i> feel a little better, thank you,&#x201d; protested Kate, who hated people to make a fuss&#x2014;well, unless it was her mother.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then I am heartily glad to hear it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I trust your luck improved after we left you, Sir Richard,&#x201d; said Parson Ledbury. &#x201c;For I grow weary of searching for confounded needles in confounded haystacks.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sir Richard beamed. &#x201c;Indeed our luck <i>did</i> improve, my dear fellow. I shall let Gideon tell you his news in person, but I gleaned a crumb or two of information myself in the city this afternoon. I admit that I was becoming a little dispirited, and I resolved to take my ease a while in the Mitre Tavern in Fleet Street. It was while I was there that I happened upon an old acquaintance, a wealthy merchant from Surrey&#x2014;and a most happy coincidence it was, for he is a great lover of horses, and his country estate adjoins that of Tempest House.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lord Luxon&#x2019;s house?&#x201d; asked Peter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Precisely, Master Schock. And when I asked him if he had seen his neighbor of late, he replied that he had seen him not two days past in Child&#x2019;s Coffee House in St. Paul&#x2019;s Churchyard. The merchant did not announce himself, however, as he was hidden behind the <i>London Gazette,</i> toasting himself in front of the fire. Lord Luxon sat at one of the small tables, in earnest conversation with a gentleman whom my friend immediately recognized as none other than Mr. Gainsborough, the portrait painter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ve seen his pictures at Tate Britain!&#x201d; exclaimed Kate.<br> <br>Sir Richard smiled. &#x201c;It does not surprise me that his fame will live on&#x2014;he has a truly remarkable talent.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter shrugged his shoulders. &#x201c;Never heard of him,&#x201d; he muttered.<br> <br>&#x201c;My acquaintance admitted that the two gentlemen&#x2019;s conversation was more interesting than his newspaper. Mr. Gainsborough, it appears, remarked to Lord Luxon that he was sick of portraits and wished instead to take up his viol de gamba and walk off into some sweet village where he could paint landscapes and enjoy the autumn of his life in quietness and ease. To which Lord Luxon replied that if only he would agree to sell him his present commission and the diverse drawings and sketches of which they had spoken, he would give Mr. Gainsborough more than enough gold to retire from society if that is what he so wished. He also advised him to invest his wealth in the American colonies, as he himself had been doing, for he was convinced that the country had a great future. ... My acquaintance observed the two fellows shake hands and leave the coffeehouse in excellent spirits.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So Lord Luxon is still in 1763!&#x201d; said Peter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or he&#x2019;s returned here,&#x201d; said Kate. &#x201c;If he knows about America, it means that he&#x2019;s learned how to use the antigravity machine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which is not such good news ...,&#x201d; said Peter.<br> <br>&#x201c;But what the devil is the fellow doing commissioning paintings?&#x201d; asked Parson Ledbury.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s easy,&#x201d; said Kate. &#x201c;A painting by Gainsborough would be worth millions in our time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ha! I thought as much!&#x201d; exclaimed Sir Richard. &#x201c;Well, if my Lord Luxon is bent on plundering his past to pay for his future, at least we stand a whisker of a chance of catching the rogue.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter&#x2019;s face brightened. &#x201c;Not to mention the antigravity machine!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have already sent a couple of fellows to Tempest House and also to Lord Luxon&#x2019;s residence in Bird Cage Walk. If Lord Luxon is still here, we shall find out before the night is out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly the drawing room door swung open, and Gideon Seymour&#x2019;s lean and agile figure appeared in the doorway. He looked about the room, and his blue eyes softened when they fell upon Kate. He nodded to the Parson, then walked over to the children and knelt at Kate&#x2019;s feet.<br> <br>&#x201c;We have promising news, Mistress Kate. There has been a sighting of the Tar Man. At Bartholomew&#x2019;s Fair. He cannot have been able to solve the puzzle of how to start up your device. If we are to stand a chance of catching up with him and the machine, we must make haste. Even if you are still not fully rested, I wonder if it would not do your heart good to help run down that foul villain who is the root and cause of your unhappiness. Will you accompany us, Mistress Kate? Shall we capture Blueskin and win back your machine?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kate jumped up from the sofa. &#x201c;Are you kidding? Of course I&#x2019;ll come! I want to see the Tar Man get a taste of his own medicine for once!&#x201d;</p><h2>Yoga and the Twelve-Step Path</h2><p>Perfect for people in recovery who want to strengthen and deepen their Eleventh-Step practice while honoring their bodily need for healing and nurturance.</p><p>This book is from my heart, my mind and my spirit - combining my passion for yoga with my love for recovery. &nbsp;I have drawn the parallels between the two philosophies, included some questions in each chapter for self study, and have included yoga postures for you to try yourself.

He is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author of the Half Upon a Time, Story Thieves, and Revenge of Magic series.Half Upon a Time Chapter 1<p></p> <br>Once upon a time, Jack wouldn&#x2019;t have been caught dead in a princess rescue. Yet here he was, in the middle of a cave&#x2014;a dark and stupid cave&#x2014;on his way to do just that. This was all such a waste of time, and after that last fight with what was apparently supposed to be a troll, his arm really hurt.<br> <br>From deep within the cave came what was probably supposed to be a bloodcurdling roar. Jack sighed, rolled his eyes, and slowed down to wait. A roar like that could only mean bad things . . . and sure enough, a ball of fire came burning down the corridor, exploding just a few inches from his left arm. The heat caused him to jerk his body to the right, saving him from the second fireball, which blew through the spot he&#x2019;d just been standing in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; Jack yelled indignantly. &#x201c;You almost hit me!&#x201d; Without waiting for a reply, he dropped to his knees, yanked out the blunt prop sword he&#x2019;d been given, and whipped it end over end toward the source of the fireballs.<br> <br>A second later Jack heard a dull thunk, followed by a groan and what sounded like a body hitting the cave floor. He smiled, then helped himself to his feet and continued on, the corridor now thankfully free of fireballs. As he walked, he looked himself over, realizing with annoyance that somewhere along the line his tan shirt and pants had both been ripped. Perfect. As if he had that many clothes to begin with.<br> <br>A bit deeper in, a bright green dragon mask lay on the floor in two separate pieces, split by the otherwise completely useless sword. Just past the mask was an unconscious boy dressed all in green, a deep red bruise spreading over his face. Apparently, Jack&#x2019;s aim had been better than he thought.<br> <br>He briefly felt bad about knocking the boy out, but then remembered how close the fireballs had come, and all guilt disappeared. Picking up his prop sword, Jack started to leave when a thought stopped him in his tracks: Why play by the rules?<br> <br>There it was, on the boy&#x2019;s right hand: a sparkling red ring. Jack quickly worked the ring off the boy&#x2019;s finger, then slid it onto his own. Satisfied, he started back down the hall, trying to ignore the growing ache in his shoulder. Stupid fake troll. At least the fake dragon had missed.<br> <br>A bit farther in, torches flickered on the cave walls, creating what would have been an eerie effect if it hadn&#x2019;t been so transparently designed to be. Again, Jack slowed down, moving as silently as he could despite the sword banging against his leg at every step. As the torchlight grew brighter and the cave started to widen, Jack stopped completely.<br> <br>This was it . . . the final challenge. The first challenge required a strong arm, he&#x2019;d been told, though if the pain in his shoulder was any indication, his arm hadn&#x2019;t exactly been up to it. The second challenge took a brave heart, facing the fireballs. And the final challenge, the most difficult of all, could only be won by a wise head.<br> <br>Wise, huh? This might not end well.<br> <br>Still, it couldn&#x2019;t hurt to get a little information before rushing in. Jack drew his sword and angled it around the corner. In the sword&#x2019;s reflection, he saw two torches hanging from the ceiling over an old, blackened stone altar. Strapped to the altar was what looked to be a teenage boy in a white dress, a golden tiara decorating his blond hair.<br> <br>A boy playing the princess? Classy.<br> <br>Over the boy in the dress stood a man wearing all brown, holding a knife to the boy&#x2019;s chest. On the other side of the room, a hunched old woman leaned against a large staff. The woman&#x2019;s black robe covered everything but her wart-infested nose, which looked more like a carrot than anything.<br> <br>&#x201c;My knight will rescue me,&#x201d; Jack heard the boy princess on the altar say in an unnaturally high-pitched voice. &#x201c;He will! Just you wait!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack sighed. A knight? Yikes. He fiddled with the ring a bit to ready it, then prepared himself to move quickly, knowing he was going to need the element of surprise if he had any hope of saving the boy . . . princess . . . whatever.<br> <br>&#x201c;The knight is here,&#x201d; the woman in black hissed.<br> <br>Okay, apparently surprise was out. Still, even if they knew he was there, maybe Jack could still throw them a bit.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am here,&#x201d; Jack said, stepping out from around the corner. &#x201c;But . . . I surrender.&#x201d; With that, he held his sword up, then slowly placed it on the ground.<br> <br>&#x201c;You what?!&#x201d; the wart-covered woman said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You what?!&#x201d; the boy princess said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I surrender,&#x201d; Jack repeated, stepping away from the sword. &#x201c;You win.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man in brown held the knife closer to the fake princess. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s some kind of trick,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>The woman nodded. &#x201c;I agree. Cut out the princess&#x2019;s heart!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; the boy princess screamed, his voice breaking in panic.<br> <br>&#x201c;Quiet, princess!&#x201d; the man in brown said, lifting his knife high into the air. &#x201c;The witch orders, and I obey!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And as for you, little hero,&#x201d; the witch said, &#x201c;you will join your princess in death!&#x201d; With that, she aimed a gnarled wand in Jack&#x2019;s direction, shouted a magic word, and shot a bolt of lightning straight at him.<br> <br>Jack dropped, then quickly dodged a second blast by rolling to the right.<br> <br>&#x201c;Princess, your heart is mine!&#x201d; the man in brown screamed, driving the knife down toward the boy on the altar.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have you now!&#x201d; the old woman shouted, aiming her wand right at Jack.<br> <br>Jack glanced quickly between the woman and the man in brown. He could either save himself or the princess, there was no time to do both. He instantly made his decision, aimed the ring, and fired it . . .<br> <br>Right at the witch.<br> <br>A fireball three times the size of the previous ones erupted from the ring and exploded into the witch&#x2019;s chest, lighting her black robe on fire. The witch screamed in terror as she frantically tore at her flaming clothing. The man in brown gasped, then rushed to the witch&#x2019;s side, dropping his knife to the ground as he ran.<br> <br>Jack used the distraction to retrieve his sword, then duck under the altar to quickly cut through the captive boy&#x2019;s bonds. &#x201c;Get up, Princess!&#x201d; he hissed, standing back up. &#x201c;We have to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>And then he stopped, realizing he was too late. The boy princess&#x2019;s white gown was now stained with some kind of red liquid, and he lay on the altar with his tongue sticking out, not moving.<br> <br>Dropping his sword to the ground, Jack put his head in his hands. He had failed. The princess was dead.<br> <br>The furious witch grabbed Jack by his shirt and pushed him against the wall, her eyes narrowed dangerously and her fake nose singed. &#x201c;Jack!&#x201d; she roared. &#x201c;You could have killed me!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, I&#x2019;m sorry!&#x201d; he said, his face turning red. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know it would do that! When Stephen used the ring, the fireballs were a lot smaller. . . .&#x201d; He quickly removed the magic ring and held it out to the woman. She glared at him for a second before grabbing it from his hand. Then she smacked him in the head.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what Stephen did,&#x201d; Julia, his teacher, told him as she tore off the rest of her makeup. &#x201c;He knew enough to miss you! You, on the other hand, aimed right at me!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, ow, first of all!&#x201d; Jack said, rubbing his head. &#x201c;Second of all, you said to treat this test like it was real. And you were shooting lightning at me! What was I supposed to do?!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Um,&#x201d; said the princess from the altar, &#x201c;can someone rescue me already?&#x201d; The princess&#x2019;s voice had gotten remarkably deeper since she &#x201c;died.&#x201d; Jack took a closer look and recognized Bertrand, one of the other boys from the village. Apparently Jack had missed some of the ropes, and Bertrand&#x2019;s arms were still tied down.<br> <br>Jack rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Rescue yourself,&#x201d; he said, tossing his fake sword to the &#x201c;princess.&#x201d; It hit the boy in his stomach, knocking the wind out of him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, congratulations, Jack,&#x201d; Julia said as she finished removing her costume. &#x201c;You failed. Not only did you handle every single situation wrong&#x2014;every single one!&#x2014;but you went after me when the real threat was the witch&#x2019;s servant. He killed the princess, Jack!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you were attacking me!&#x201d; Jack protested. &#x201c;If I had saved her, I would have died. And then what good would I have been to either of us?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And what good were you now?&#x201d; Julia asked as the man in brown, Jack&#x2019;s teacher Stewart, quietly walked over to untie the still complaining princess.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all useless anyway,&#x201d; Jack said, his face burning from his failure. &#x201c;We all know there are no unmarried princesses left. Even if there were, I don&#x2019;t want to marry anyone, let alone some stuck-up royal. I&#x2019;m just fine where I am!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack turned to leave, but Julia grabbed his arm. &#x201c;This is important, Jack. You&#x2019;re the son of a . . . well, a . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A criminal?&#x201d; Jack said, his eyes narrowing.<br> <br>&#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t want you to follow his lead,&#x201d; Julia said. &#x201c;This is for your own good! Being a hero, rescuing a princess, killing a dragon . . . these could really turn your life around! At least, if you survive long enough.&#x201d; She glared at him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the only one in your entire class to fail the princess rescue test. Just go home, Jack. We&#x2019;ll talk about this later.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack sighed, and turned to leave. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care how the world works,&#x201d; he said over his shoulder. &#x201c;All this? It isn&#x2019;t me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And it never will be at this rate,&#x201d; Julia said, helping Stewart to yank the ropes off the fake princess.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks for nothing, Jack!&#x201d; the &#x201c;princess&#x201d; yelled at him, his wig and tiara falling off as he sat up.<br> <br>The walk back through the cave was a bit more peaceful this time, though that wouldn&#x2019;t last long. His grandfather would be waiting, and Jack&#x2019;s test results weren&#x2019;t going to go over too well.<br> <br>Outside, the brightly setting sun blinded him for a moment. He raised a hand up to block it, as the green trees of summer weren&#x2019;t helping too much in that regard. He realized that it wouldn&#x2019;t be much longer before the trees picked themselves up and migrated to the warmer south, leaving their dead, leafless brothers behind.<br> <br>Lucky trees.<br> <br>Between those trees, an old man tapped his foot impatiently. Jack&#x2019;s grandfather was covered in three or four layers of different-colored clothing, while his long white beard poked out from his shirt in several places. None of that was out of the ordinary, though. The tiny, golden girl sitting on his grandfather&#x2019;s shoulder, however, was a bit unusual. The girl&#x2019;s wings shimmered in the sunlight as she flapped them absently.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, Grandpa,&#x201d; Jack said, hoping a smile would help hide his failure. &#x201c;New friend?&#x201d;<br> <br>His grandfather snorted, then gently offered his palm to the fairy on his shoulder. The creature daintily stepped into it, smiling shyly up at Jack as his grandfather walked over. &#x201c;Just caught that bully Robert hunting some of these things,&#x201d; the old man said. &#x201c;The other three flew off when I rescued them, but this one seems to have a thing for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Before he could even finish speaking, though, the fairy jumped out of his hand and flew over to Jack. She landed on his head, settled herself into his hair, and let out a contented sigh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or not,&#x201d; his grandfather said with a grunt. &#x201c;How did the test go?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack took in a deep breath, then blew it out without a word.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; said his grandfather, nodding. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m surprised. What was the problem this time?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack turned red. &#x201c;I kinda let the princess die.&#x201d;<br> <br>His grandfather groaned. &#x201c;You do realize that&#x2019;s not a good thing, right?&#x201d; the old man asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;m told,&#x201d; Jack said.<br> <br>His grandfather patted him on the shoulder. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll save her next time. Until then, you&#x2019;ll practice every minute that you&#x2019;re not working in the fields.&#x201d;<br> <br>And there it was, pretty much the worst punishment his grandfather could have laid down. The last thing Jack wanted to do was practice more princess rescuing. The whole thing was just so useless!<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not useless,&#x201d; his grandfather said, apparently reading his mind. &#x201c;You think I&#x2019;m going to let my only grandson stay a farmer for the rest of his life? That&#x2019;s a job for kids too young or adults too old to go out on a proper adventure. Now, let&#x2019;s get back to the cottage. There&#x2019;s a chill in the air.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You realize it&#x2019;s the middle of summer, right?&#x201d; Jack asked as they started home. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure any chill is just in your head.&#x201d;<br> <br>That earned Jack a whack on the head from his grandfather&#x2019;s cane. &#x201c;I fought an ice giant, you little idiot!&#x201d; the old man snapped. &#x201c;The monster froze my bones to their very core, and they&#x2019;ve never properly healed! Usually it&#x2019;s worse when I&#x2019;m around the truly stupid.&#x201d; He gave Jack a dark look. &#x201c;You see where I&#x2019;m going with this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll start a fire when we get home,&#x201d; Jack said with a sigh. On top of his head, the fairy made herself a little nest, tugging some of his hair in the process. Unlike this one, most fairies were shy, scared of humans for a good reason: Their wings sold pretty well to wizards and witches for their magic. The practice was horribly cruel, but that didn&#x2019;t stop some of the village boys from hunting the little fairies.<br> <br>&#x201c;A fire&#x2019;s a start,&#x201d; the old man said. &#x201c;And then tomorrow we&#x2019;ll go over my adventuring lessons again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack gritted his teeth. &#x201c;Grandpa, I&#x2019;m not going to waste my time anymore!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not you . . . and I&#x2019;m definitely not my father. What&#x2019;s the point, anyway? There aren&#x2019;t any unmarried princesses left!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And how would you know?!&#x201d; his grandfather shouted back. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not even looking! If you go looking for adventure, it will find you! At least, it would if you had the brains nature gave your little fairy friend&#x2014;the one who&#x2019;s scratching her head with her foot, I might add.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If adventure&#x2019;s going to find me,&#x201d; Jack growled angrily, &#x201c;it can find me right here. If you&#x2019;re right, it shouldn&#x2019;t matter where I am. I should be able to just stick out my arms and have a princess fall right into them!&#x201d;<br> <br>He stuck out his arms to highlight how stupid his grandfather&#x2019;s argument was.<br> <br>Above him, a circle of blue fire exploded open in the middle of the air. Out of the middle of the flaming circle, a person fell to the ground less than a foot from Jack&#x2019;s outstretched arms.<br> <br>For a second, both Jack and his grandfather were too shocked to say anything.<br> <br>As usual, though, his grandfather recovered first.<br> <br>&#x201c;You really have to work on your aim, boy,&#x201d; the old man said.<br> <br>Jack quickly ran forward to see if the person&#x2014;a girl&#x2014;was hurt. She was lying on her stomach, so Jack quickly turned her over, sighing in relief when he saw she was still breathing. He looked her over, trying to figure out if she&#x2019;d broken anything, but she seemed okay . . . that was, other than her odd appearance.<br> <br>The strangest thing had to be the streak of startling blue playing through the girl&#x2019;s dirty blond hair. That couldn&#x2019;t have been natural; some sort of magic had to have been involved. Not that her clothing was normal, either. Her pants were dark blue, worn through in some places but almost new in others. Her black shirt was a much thinner material than her pants and barely had any sleeves. And then Jack saw something that made him gasp in surprise.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; his grandfather asked, creeping up behind Jack to look. &#x201c;Is it dead?&#x201d;<br> <br>The old man noticed what Jack had seen, and he leapt into the air, almost giddy with excitement. &#x201c;Jack, my boy!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve done it, you&#x2019;ve found one!&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack shook his head, still staring at the girl. She couldn&#x2019;t be . . . could she? He read the words on her shirt again, out loud this time. &#x201c;Punk . . . Princess.&#x201d;<br> <br>This girl was a...</p><h2>Ivy and Bean Take the Case: Book 10 (Best Friends Books for Kids, Elementary School Books, Early Chapter Books) (Ivy &amp; Bean)</h2><p>Watch out, you diabolical masterminds!

Set in a lushly detailed city of the far future, catmaster Joe, assisted by his marvelously mutable drug-fueled cat Earthling J. Catingsworth the Third, faces an assortment of conflicts, from a mysterious and ominous cult to a friend's desire to rescue an alien woman from a futuristic mob. Joe is in his element against mere eldritch horrors, mysterious femme fatales and the seedy criminal underworld, but finds himself less able to handle the lingering presence of his former lover Anna, now romantically entangled with a troubled but amiable war veteran.

That it&#x2019;s two months of pure teenage bliss or something. It&#x2019;s almost as if there&#x2019;s this big conspiracy surrounding it, like, sure, kid, throw your cap in the air, cue up that hit pop song you will definitely hate by fall, and then you, too, will be guaranteed the most epic summer of your life. I mean, we all know that&#x2019;s not how it actually goes down, right?<br><br> Even though I won&#x2019;t kick off my own senior year for another couple of months, I&#x2019;ve already witnessed way more than my fair share of post-senior summers. It&#x2019;s a hazard of attending a tiny school&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t really be picky about how old your friends are. But yeah, I think I can conclusively say that frantically searching Target for extra-long twin bedsheets while freaking out about what to major in does not an epic summer make.<br><br> So no, I don&#x2019;t buy into that whole post-senior-year magic thing. I think <i>pre</i>-senior year is where it&#x2019;s at, and for me, that starts right here in this tiny breakroom&#x2014;with a stomach full of butterflies and a brain full of fireworks.<br><br> This is going to be my summer, no doubt about it.<br><br> I take a deep breath and slide my finger down the crisp page in front of me, searching for my name on the corkboard of destiny. Seriously. That&#x2019;s what we call stuff like this at Magic Castle Playland. It&#x2019;s not a bulletin board; it&#x2019;s a &#x201c;corkboard of destiny.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s not a list of job assignments; it&#x2019;s a &#x201c;character reveal chart.&#x201d; I swear to god everything here is about as whimsical as it is rusty.<br><br> I look lower, past the names of the ride operators and the food service people, over housekeeping and maintenance, until I get to the costume crew. I pause at the listing for princess. It&#x2019;s not my name. Okay, that&#x2019;s fine, disappointing but fine. I knew it was a long shot when I put in for it. My finger dips even lower, gliding past the prince, and the pirates, and all the furry park mascots, until it hits my name: Elouise May Parker. I drop my head against the board. No, no, no. Not again. I can&#x2019;t. This has to be a mistake.<br><br> My best friend, Seeley, nudges me out of the way. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s it say?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the hot dog.&#x201d;<br><br> Pity flashes in her hazel eyes. &#x201c;It could be worse.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Could it, See? Could it really?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah! What if they put you in housekeeping and you were stuck in the bathroom by Swashbuckler Bay?&#x201d; She shudders, cracking herself up.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not funny.&#x201d; I pout, but technically, yes, that would be worse. I mean, the bathroom crew finishes every shift smelling like mildew and old diapers, so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br><br> Seeley holds up her hands. &#x201c;Hey, I&#x2019;m just kidding, but it&#x2019;s going to be okay, Lou, promise.&#x201d;<br><br> She&#x2019;s right. I know she is. This is a minor speed bump. I mean, it&#x2019;s not like anybody died or there&#x2019;s a giant meteor about to strike Earth or anything. But still, there are so many things I have planned for these last few months before we&#x2019;re sucked up in the frenzy of senior year, and playing the hot dog isn&#x2019;t one of them.<br><br> I glance back at the list, letting out a little humph, and then look back at Seeley with an exaggerated frown. She bursts out laughing, shaking so hard her teal hair tips right into her sun-kissed face. Seeley&#x2019;s always got it a different color these days, almost like a mood ring. The happier she is, the brighter her hair gets.<br><br> Meanwhile I&#x2019;m her slightly duller, significantly paler sidekick. My skin doesn&#x2019;t tan&#x2014;it just burns&#x2014;and my hair is this permanent mousy brown color because it doesn&#x2019;t hold dye. My dad calls it &#x201c;caramel brown,&#x201d; which makes me think it&#x2019;s been way too long since he&#x2019;s actually seen any caramel.<br><br> Seeley grins and shoves her bangs out of her face as we start to walk toward the main stage for orientation. &#x201c;Seriously, what are the odds that a vegetarian ends up in a hot dog suit two years in a row?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Shut up. What did you get?&#x201d; I almost hope it&#x2019;s something awful like the Scrambler, where she&#x2019;s guaranteed to clean up tons of puke on the daily. It&#x2019;s only fair we both suffer.<br><br> &#x201c;The carousel.&#x201d; She shrugs, her lips twisting into a smirk.<br><br> &#x201c;I hate you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She laughs. &#x201c;Besides, would you honestly rather have Marcus or Brynn in charge of the carousel? They&#x2019;d have Butters and Racer scratched all to hell from day one.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I would kill them.&#x201d;<br><br> Seeley crosses her arms. &#x201c;Exactly. So really, you should be thanking me for helping you avoid a lengthy prison sentence.&#x201d;<br><br> I snort, running my hand along the rock wall. This is the only time of year I even dare to touch it, the only time when it&#x2019;s still sort of semi-clean&#x2014;well, as clean as the filthy old rock wall of a run-down amusement park can be, anyway. But tomorrow the gates will open, and everything will be sticky from the sweat and garbage of our less-than-stellar clientele.<br><br> I drop my hand, smiling at the familiar sight of co-workers finding seats and talking excitedly to everybody they haven&#x2019;t seen since the last time the cold broke in our unforgiving little mountain town. Most of them aren&#x2019;t townies like me; some of them live in neighboring areas, and some of them&#x2014;the lifers, as I like to call them&#x2014;follow the seasons. They spend their summers up here where it&#x2019;s a little bit cooler, and the winters down south where the weather is mild. <br><br> You don&#x2019;t realize how many people it takes to run an amusement park, even an old midsize one like ours, until you try to cram them all into the seats at Mr. Johnny&#x2019;s Magic Emporium. Even though our little rust bucket can&#x2019;t compete with the corporate giants, we have some cool stuff here&#x2014;a couple roller coasters, some games, enough rides to pass an afternoon, and, of course, our namesake: a tiny pink castle smack-dab in the middle of the park&#x2014;and it takes tons of people to keep it going each day.<br><br> Tons of people who are currently causing a human-shaped traffic jam right ahead of me. I take a sharp right and turn down the lower path to hit up the amphitheater&#x2019;s side entrance. Seeley follows close behind me, stepping hard on the back of my sneaker, so hard my heel pops out. I glare at her, grabbing onto her arm for support as I fix my shoe.<br><br> &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; Her voice lilts up like this isn&#x2019;t an offense punishable by death.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, Seeley,&#x201d; a boy says, nodding at her as he walks by. It&#x2019;s Nick, because of course it would be Nick when I&#x2019;m hunched over looking like I don&#x2019;t know how to operate a shoe. Seeley lifts her hand to wave and nearly sends me sprawling. Thanks for that, universe.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, Nick.&#x201d; I smile, jumping forward as I regain my balance.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, Elouise.&#x201d; He nods.<br><br> &#x201c;Elle, Nick, call me Elle.&#x201d; I grit my teeth.<br><br> He clamps his hand on my shoulder, and I praise the gods that I decided to wear a tank top today. &#x201c;If &#x2018;Elle&#x2019; hasn&#x2019;t stuck by now, it&#x2019;s never going to. But I applaud your determination.&#x201d; He squeezes his fingers a little like he&#x2019;s giving me a massage and oh, okay, no big deal. I&#x2019;ll just be over here dying because Nick&#x2019;s skin is touching my skin and that&#x2019;s&#x2014;<br><br> &#x201c;Have you guys seen Jessa?&#x201d; he asks.<br><br> Oh, right. Jessa. His super beautiful, so-nice-it-hurts girlfriend. How could I ever forget?<br><br> &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t seen her,&#x201d; I grumble, but then Seeley pokes me in the ribs and I force out a smile. &#x201c;She might still be checking the list.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, yeah. How&#x2019;d you two make out?&#x201d; Nick shoves his hands into his pockets, and I try not to frown from the loss of contact.<br><br> &#x201c;Carousel.&#x201d; Seeley grins, which Nick apparently thinks deserves a high five.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the hot dog. Again,&#x201d; I blurt out, which apparently Nick thinks doesn&#x2019;t. Not that I can blame him. My face burns and I huff out a breath so big my cheeks puff out.<br><br> Nick opens and shuts his mouth a few times, like he doesn&#x2019;t know where to start. &#x201c;Another year in the bun? Tough break, Elouise.&#x201d; He shakes his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so lucky I don&#x2019;t have to deal with random jobs.&#x201d;<br><br> He is lucky; I&#x2019;m glad he realizes that. See, Nick&#x2019;s a diving pirate, which isn&#x2019;t exactly a job you can just walk into. He swam for his old school, I think, and he made the dive team at ours like two seconds after he moved here. He even got a partial scholarship to Presley University this fall, which I&#x2019;m pretending doesn&#x2019;t exist. The last thing I want to think about is him leaving for college. But anyway, yeah, he doesn&#x2019;t have to worry about being a hot dog because he&#x2019;s too busy being the absolute best pirate on the planet. No way will Mr. P ever assign him anywhere else.<br><br> Nick brushes his hair out of his eyes. &#x201c;All right, I&#x2019;m gonna go look for Jessa and find the guys. I&#x2019;ll catch up with you later.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Bye,&#x201d; I say, a little too eagerly, and I swear I see a tiny shake of his head as he walks away.<br><br> &#x201c;Bye,&#x201d; Seeley repeats, stretching the word out with a little giggle. It&#x2019;s simultaneously her best and worst impression of me.<br><br> I wait until he disappears around the corner, then widen my eyes. &#x201c;He totally just massaged my shoulder. You saw that, right? He was all in.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All in on squeezing your shoulder?&#x201d; If there&#x2019;s some kind of world record for highest eyebrow raise ever, I&#x2019;m pretty sure Seeley just broke it.<br><br> &#x201c;He massaged it. You witnessed it. It was glorious.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh my god, Lou, it finally happened: you&#x2019;ve lost your last remaining marble.&#x201d; I try to elbow her, but she grabs my arm, laughing.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, guys.&#x201d; Angie Martinez appears out of nowhere right then, giving Seeley a little nod as she skirts around us. Her black hair is pulled tight in a ponytail, which bounces against her light brown skin as she walks down the hill to the Emporium. Angie&#x2019;s a year ahead of us, like Nick, and she runs the Ferris wheel. I&#x2019;m 93 percent sure she&#x2019;s got a thing for Seeley, but I&#x2019;m also about 100 percent sure Seeley is oblivious.<br><br> Seeley tugs my arm, snapping my attention back to her. &#x201c;Come on, Lou, let&#x2019;s go find a place to sit.&#x201d;</p><h2>Small and Scrappy: Pint-Size Patchwork Quilts Using Reproduction Fabrics</h2><p><p>Based on traditional patterns, these delightful little patchwork treasures are perfect additions to a quilter's decor.

Following up on Prestel&#x2019;s books Art Forms in Nature and Art Forms from the Ocean, this new collection features startlingly beautiful images created by Haeckel for the report of the HMS Challenger expedition, which circumnavigated the world from 1872&#x2013;76, discovering<br>and cataloging nearly 5,000 new species from the depths of<br>Earth&#x2019;s oceans. Full-page reproductions bring these organisms<br>colorfully to life, drawing readers into a world at once<br>hypnotic and highly ordered. Divided into three sections&#x2015;<br>Siphonophores, Medusae, and Radiolarians&#x2015;these illustrations<br>display Haeckel&#x2019;s remarkable artistic skill and understanding of<br>the architecture of organic matter. The authors provide a brief<br>history of the Challenger expedition, background on Haeckel&#x2019;s<br>scientific and artistic accomplishments, as well as informative<br>texts on each group of organisms. A guide to the natural world<br>and an inspiration to artists of every stripe, this collection of<br>Haeckel&#x2019;s work is a fitting tribute to a 19th-century genius.</p><p>Peter Williams is Emeritus Professor at the School of Ocean Sciences, Bangor University, Wales. David Roberts is Scientific and Technical Photographer and David Thomas is Professor of Marine Biology. Dylan Evans is an environmental and fisheries consultant."The book&#x2019;s introduction provides important context to help the reader appreciate the images on a level beyond the purely aesthetic. It covers the changing scientific climate that led to such an ambitious expedition, the understanding of ocean life at the time, Haeckel&#x2019;s career, and the role of his lithographers in coloring and completing his works. . . While the introduction focuses on history and science, the book is primarily a celebration of the visual, and highlights both the intriguing forms of the creatures and the delicate rendering of the illustrations. . . Haeckel&#x2019;s plates offer a perspective that modern imaging cannot. With their ability to guide our attention to specific details, the illustrations add an air of the fantastical, and encourage the viewer to consider both the science and the art of life in the ocean." <p> <i>Hakai Magazine</i></p></p><h2>Absolute Boyfriend, Vol. 3</h2><p>Shy high school student Riko Izawa aches for a boyfriend but guys just won't look her way.

Where whisky shops the livelong night Are vending out their poison juice; Where men are often very tight, And women deemed a trifle loose?

Once I began reading this brilliant book I could not put it down. Anderson provides an incredibly rich narrative of the interactions of city dwellers from different segregated neighborhoods-ghettos, ethnic enclaves, and suburbs-in public places. By revealing hidden social and racial dynamics, Anderson not only explains the conditions that ease racial tensions and promote interracial harmony, but those that reinforce traditional racial boundaries as well. This book is a must read.&#34;-William Julius Wilson, Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor. Harvard University &#34;Elijah Anderson is a master ethnographer. Field research is a way of life for him, a medium through which unceasingly, over the course of many years, he has courageously explored the innermost recesses of life in an American city, especially the social worlds and the experiences of Black Americans. Once again, in The Cosmopolitan Canopy, he moves from one area of Philadelphia to another, exploring the patterns of social interaction and behavior in various public places. Anderson calls these urban spaces &#39;cosmopolitan canopies&#39; - a concept likely to evoke lively, illuminating discussion.&#34;-Renee C. Fox, Annenberg Professor Emerita of the Social Sciences, University of Pennsylvania &#34;This is the most important book on race relations in many years. Elijah Anderson takes us behind the statistics into the scenes of everyday life. We witness front-stage performances of integration and back-stage racial ethnocentrism, as well as the venues where interracial cosmopolitan civility is constructed. Updating E. Franklin Frazier&#39;s classic Black Bourgeoisie, The Cosmopolitan Canopy offers a gift for our pessimistic times: a book of realistic optimism.&#34;-Randall Collins, President of the American Sociological Association &#34;The Cosmopolitan Canopy is a richly detailed account of how the public spaces we all share can either separate or help bring us together. I strongly recommend it.&#34;-Marian Wright Edelman, President, Children&#39;s Defense FundElijah Anderson holds the William K.

Black men are always under watch, and police violence is widespread&#x2014;all with the support of judges and politicians.<br> <br>In his no-holds-barred style, Butler, whose scholarship has been featured on <i>60 Minutes</i>, uses new data to demonstrate that white men commit the majority of violent crime in the United States. For example, a white woman is ten times more likely to be raped by a white male acquaintance than be the victim of a violent crime perpetrated by a black man. Butler also frankly discusses the problem of black on black violence and how to keep communities safer&#x2014;without relying as much on police.<br> <br> <i>Chokehold</i> powerfully demonstrates why current efforts to reform law enforcement will not create lasting change. Butler&#x2019;s controversial recommendations about how to crash the system, and when it&#x2019;s better for a black man to plead guilty&#x2014;even if he&#x2019;s innocent&#x2014;are sure to be game-changers in the national debate about policing, criminal justice, and race relations.</p><p>A former federal prosecutor, <b>Paul Butler</b> provides legal commentary for MSNBC and NPR and has been featured on <em>60 Minutes</em> and profiled in the <em>Washington Post</em>.

This 3-volume series records his meetings with individual seekers from all walks of life, during which he comments on the struggles common to those who work to break the boundaries of personality and self-limitation. In the first volume Krishnamurti discusses many topics, including knowledge, belief, simplicity of the heart, love in relationship, ambition, and clarity in action.</p><p>Commentaries on Living records Krishnamurti&#39;s meeting with individual seekers of the truth from all walks of life.J. Krishnamurti (1895-1986) was a renowned spiritual teacher whose lectures and writings have inspired thousands. His works include On Mind and Thought, On Nature and the Environment, On Relationship, On Living and Dying, On Love and Lonliness, On Fear, and On Freedom.<br><br>Jiddu Krishnamurti lived from 1895 to 1986, and is regarded as one of the greatest philosophical and spiritual figures of the twentieth century. He was first discovered by the Theosophists on a beach in South India in 1910 at the age of 13 and was educated to be the new World Teacher for the ages. Then he took an extraordinary turn. In 1929, at one of the enormous annual European gatherings of the Theosophists in Holland, he announced his decision to step down from any formal role to promote him as a World Teacher, resigned as figure head of the Theosophists, and cut all ties to any notion of a religious or spiritual organization.Krishnamurti claimed no allegiance to any caste, nationality or religion and was bound by no tradition. His purpose was to set humankind unconditionally free from the destructive limitations of a conditioned mind. For nearly sixty years, he traveled the world and spoke spontaneously to large audiences until the end of his life in 1986 at the age of 90. He had no permanent home, but when not traveling, he often stayed in Ojai, California, Brockwood Park, England, and in Chennai, India. In his talks, he pointed out to people the need to transform themselves through self knowledge, by being aware of the subtleties of their thoughts and feelings in daily life, and how this movement can be observed through the mirror of relationship.</p><h2>The Struggle Against the State and Other Essays</h2><p>A collection of essays and articles from the Ukranian revolutionary, Nestor Makhno, who fought against encroaching Bolshevik terror during the Russian Revolution. <i>The Struggle Against the State and other Essays</i> sheds valuable insight onto the man and the movement that bore his name.</p><p>Born of peasant stock in Gwlyog-Polye, Ukraine, Nestor Makhno became an anarchist after the Russian Revolution of 1905. Sentenced to death for armed struggle, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Liberated in 1917, he organized an army of anarchist resistance against both the Bolsheviks and the White counter-revolutionaries. Throughout his period of struggle, he consistently advocated the creation of anarchist communism in the most difficult and impractical of conditions. Forced to flee by the Bolsheviks, he eventually ended up in exile in Paris. Marginalized and impoverished, in poor health as a result of wounds sustained in fighting against the Whites and the Bolsheviks, and time spent in prisons inside tsarist Russia before the Revolution and in Eastern European prisons en route to exile afterwards, Nestor Makhno wrote occasional essays in self-vindication and in vindication of the peasant insurgent movement that bore his name. Published primarily for fellow-exiles, these essays ranged from the theoretical and analytical, establishing him plainly as a deliberate as well as a visceral anarchist, to challenges thrown out to his enemiesincluding some Jewish anarchists - to produce proof of the alleged anti-Semitism of his movement in revolutionary Ukraine. He remained politically active, contributing to Delo Truda and other papers, and helped create the Organizational Platform Of The Libertarian Communists. Makhno was determined that the next time anarchism, acting in the light of experiences dearly bought, revamped and more disciplined thanks to its Organizational Platform, might reap the rewards proportionate with the commitment and sacrifice of its activists. Nestor Makhnodied from tuberculosis on July 25, 1934, aged 44. The essays in this volume date from his period in exile.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Lost Children of Wilder: The Epic Struggle to Change Foster Care</h2><p>IIn 1973, a young ACLU attorney filed a controversial class-action lawsuit that challenged New York City&#x2019;s operation of its foster-care system. The plaintiff was an abused runaway named Shirley Wilder who had suffered from the system&#x2019;s inequities. <i>Wilder</i>, as the case came to be known, was waged for two and a half decades, becoming a battleground for the conflicts of race, religion, and politics that shape America&#x2019;s child-welfare system.<br><br><b>The Lost Children of Wilder</b> gives us the galvanizing history of this landmark case and the personal story at its core. Nina Bernstein takes us behind the scenes of far-reaching legal and legislative battles, but she also traces the life of Shirley Wilder and her son, Lamont, born when Shirley was only fourteen and relinquished to the very system being challenged in her name. Bernstein&#x2019;s account of Shirley and Lamont&#x2019;s struggles captures the heartbreaking consequences of the child welfare system&#x2019;s best intentions and deepest flaws. In the tradition of <i>There Are No Children Here</i>, this is a major achievement of investigative journalism and a tour de force of social observation, a gripping book that will haunt every reader who cares about the needs of children.</p><p>At age 12, Shirley Wilder ran away from an abusive home and landed in New York City's foster-care system. By age 13, she was named the plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit that challenged the city's 150-year-old system as unconstitutional. At 14, Shirley gave birth to a son, Lamont, who was soon swept up in the same system. This absorbing account by <i>New York Times</i> reporter Nina Bernstein follows the threads of the tragic lives of Shirley and Lamont Wilder and the lawsuit that bears their name. In the process it illuminates the city's--and the nation's--dysfunctional social welfare system and its impact on the children it purportedly helps. <p> The Wilder lawsuit was filed in 1973 by a passionate young lawyer who stuck by it through 26 years of litigation, without the case ever being fully resolved. The accusation: that New York City's system violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments for giving private religious agencies control of publicly financed foster-care beds. These mostly Catholic and Jewish agencies gave preference to white Catholic and Jewish children, while the growing numbers of black and Protestant children were sent to inappropriate institutions that left them with more problems than they had when they came. Such was the fate of Shirley, who, for lack of anywhere else to go, was placed in Hudson, a state reformatory for delinquents with no treatment services for abandoned or abused children. Hudson "looked like a camp from the outside and was unmistakably a prison within." There was rampant violence and sexual abuse, and girls were regularly punished by being put in "the hole," a 5-by-8-foot cell with no windows, furniture, or heat, which Shirley would later testify was like "Winter. Winter--all year round." But a case that named state and city officials, 77 voluntary agencies and their directors, and 84 individual defendants including nuns, rabbis, and clergymen, and that threatened to pit blacks and Jews against each other, was a case destined to enter a legal wilderness of avoidance and delay. </p><p> Shirley and Lamont's unforgettable stories reveal the deep fault lines in a system that often does more harm than good. While reforms come and go with little success, Bernstein makes clear that the child welfare system will never really change until there is a coming to terms with the system's place as "a political battleground for abiding national conflicts over race, religion, gender and inequality" and the "unacknowledged contradictions between policies that punish the 'undeserving poor' and pledge to help all needy children." <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>&#x201c;A wrenching account. . . .

As our Heavenly Father, He wants to fulfill His dream for our lives. So many times we miss God's best because we don't give Him the opportunity to guide and direct us on a daily basis. Giving God an opportunity to fulfill His dream for our lives is what <em>The First Hour</em> is all about. In <em>The First Hour</em>, Mark W. Koch gives men a simple pathway that will help them become true men of God in every area of their lives. <em>The First Hour</em> will help men better understand how to obey and serve God, how to grow closer to their family and friends, how to take better care of themselves physically, and how to make the most of the gifts that God has given them.

He has produced several A-list films including the number one box office hit <em>Lost in Space</em>. Dedicating his life to God, he is now committed to spreading the message of Jesus Christ through faith-based global media, including books and feature films. He is the Chairman of Prelude Pictures which produces and markets morally responsible, message-based family films. Mark was born in Detroit Michigan and is a graduate of Northwood University. In 1992 he founded Prelude Pictures. By 1995 he had produced his first film titled, <em>Judicial Consent</em>, a Home Box Office world premier which set the new HBO February ratings record. He soon became a powerful force in Hollywood with two major box office hits. In April 1998, <em>Lost in Space</em>, the $90 million big-budget blockbuster, knocked <em>Titanic</em> from the number one spot and set a box office record for the highest ever April opening of a motion picture. Three weeks later, <em>Black Dog</em>, starring Patrick Swayze, joined <em>Lost in Space</em> to credit Prelude Pictures with two major films in the elite, top ten categories simultaneously, an unequaled feat in the motion picture industry. Six months later, Prelude again attained premier status with<em> Lost in Space</em> debuting in the number one spot for both video rentals and sales. Prelude Pictures then echoed its success when <em>Lost in Space</em> and <em>Black Dog</em> remained on the top ten video charts for four consecutive weeks. In December 1997, four months prior to the opening of <em>Lost in Space</em>, God touched Mark's heart and at the height of his career, he decided to take a hiatus from the film business to concentrate on his family life and pursue his newfound passion to serve God. In 2003, after leaving the film business for nearly five years, Mark accepted the challenge from Mel Gibson and Icon Productions to assist in the promotion and marketing of <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>. Prelude and their partner, ISA, built a coalition of more than 50 faith-based organizations including Pat Robertson, CBN, TBN, Robert Shuller, Promise Keepers, The Catholic Exchange, Lifeway, and many more. Through these strategic partnerships, Prelude garnered the support of tens of millions of Christians and helped propel <em>The Passion of the Christ</em> to a record-breaking opening. In April 2006, Koch headed back to Hollywood and in only six short months, <em>The Perfect Game</em> went into production in the fall of 2006. This true story of the 1957 Little League World Series and the rag tag barefoot team from Monterrey, Mexico was Koch's first picture in almost 10 years. Produced by Koch and his Prelude Pictures, the film was released theatrically nationwide on April 6th of 2011. Mr. Koch is also founder of Prelude Motorsports, Inc. and through this company manages his son Blake Koch's NASCAR Nationwide/Sprint Cup career.</p><h2>Spark (Swipe Series)</h2><p><p><strong>In a future United States under the power of a charismatic leader, everyone gets the Mark at age thirteen.

Their goal: to smash the main factories and production centers of the Luftwaffe while also drawing German planes into an aerial battle of attrition to neutralize the Luftwaffe as a fighting force prior to the cross-channel invasion, planned for a few months later. Officially called Operation ARGUMENT, this aerial offensive quickly became known as &#x201c;Big Week,&#x201d; and it was one of the turning-point engagements of World War II.<br><p><br>In <i>Big Week</i>, acclaimed World War II historian James Holland chronicles the massive air battle through the experiences of those who lived and died during it. Prior to Big Week, the air forces on both sides were in crisis. Allied raids into Germany were being decimated, but German resources&#x2015;fuel and pilots&#x2015;were strained to the breaking point. Ultimately new Allied aircraft&#x2015;especially the American long-range P-51 Mustang&#x2015;and superior tactics won out during Big Week. Through interviews, oral histories, diaries, and official records, Holland follows the fortunes of pilots, crew, and civilians on both sides, taking readers from command headquarters to fighter cockpits to anti-aircraft positions and civilian chaos on the ground, vividly recreating the campaign as it was conceived and unfolded. In the end, the six days of intense air battles largely cleared the skies of enemy aircraft when the invasion took place on June 6, 1944&#x2015;D-Day.<br></p><p><br><i>Big Week</i> is both an original contribution to WWII literature and a brilliant piece of narrative history, recapturing a largely forgotten campaign that was one of the most critically important periods of the entire war.</p></p><p><b>James Holland</b> is a historian, writer, and broadcaster. The author of <i>The Rise of Germany, 1939-1941</i> and <i>The Allies Strike Back, 1941-1943</i>, the first two books in The War in the West series, as well as the bestselling <i>Fortress Malta</i>, <i>Battle of Britain</i>, and <i>Dam Busters</i>, he has also written numerous works of historical fiction. Holland regularly appears on television and radio and has written and presented the BAFTA-shortlisted documentaries <i>Battle of Britain</i> and <i>Dam Busters</i> for the BBC, among others. His writing has appeared in magazines and newspapers including the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i>, for whom he went to Helmand Province in Afghanistan, the <i>Times</i>, <i>Daily Mail</i>, and <i>BBC History Magazine</i>. A fellow of the Royal Historical Society, and cofounder and program director of the hugely successful Chalke Valley History Festival, Holland has also advised the British government on history curriculum and has his own collection at the Imperial War Museum.<i>February 19, 1944</i><p><br>Some 170 miles away to the south at US Strategic Air Force Headquarters at Bushey Park, General Toohey Spaatz was taking direct control of Operation ARGUMENT. While he still believed air power alone could bring about the defeat of Germany, he had accepted that OVERLORD was going to happen and that from April, his strategic air forces&#x2015;and those of the RAF&#x2015;would come under the direct authority of Eisenhower as Supreme Allied Commander. <br></p><p><br> Yet for OVERLORD to be successful, that all-important criteria&#x2015;air superiority over much of France and northern Europe&#x2015;remained. Since the start of the year, Eighth Air Force had been chipping away at the Luftwaffe. Doolittle&#x2019;s and Kepner&#x2019;s new fighter tactics were bearing fruit and with more long-range Mustangs on their way, the time was right for a much more concentrated and sustained assault on the Luftwaffe. No longer was it a matter of bombers heading to a target, dropping bombs and heading back. It was also now a matter of using the bomber formations as bait to entice the German fighters into combat with their own increasingly large fighter force. Strategic air power had always been about bombers. Now, six months after the first deep-penetration bombing raids, that belief had been cast aside, because perhaps even more important than the bombers were the fighters. Fighters piloted by men of superior skill and training. Fighter aircraft that had greater speed and agility than those of the enemy and in greater numbers. Fighters that had greater endurance too, that could maraud deep into Germany, hammering the beleaguered enemy in the air and on the ground.</p></p><h2>Sunstroke and Other Stories</h2><p><p><b>A Picador Paperback Original</b></p><p>Tessa Hadley's stories trace the currents of desire, desperation, and mischief that that lie hidden inside domestic relationships.</p><p>A mother hears her son's confession that he's cheating on his girlfriend; a student falls in love with a professor and initiates an affair with a man who looks just like him.

Four of the stories in Sunstroke were published in <i>The New Yorker</i>. Hadley lives in Cardiff, Wales. Her novel <i>The Master Bedroom</i> was published by Henry Holt.Ten elegant stories from Welsh author Hadley (Everything Will Be All Right) explore the various stages of women's experience. The title story, set at a seaside cottage in Wales and told in an austerely omniscient voice, tracks two attractive early-30ish mothers, one married, the other partnered, who each begin a flirtation with a visiting doctor friend. In Mother's Son, the other woman in an adulterous affair that ended 20 years before finds herself ruefully counseling her grown son&#x2014;the product of the affair&#x2014;on dealing with his romantic troubles. Each of these beautifully crafted tales (some set in the 1970s) encapsulates a tender, transformative moment for these real characters, such as the provincial vicar's daughter in Buckets of Blood sent up to visit her older sister in Cambridge for the week who finds, to her horror and disappointment, her sister reeling from a miscarriage that puts her, like their worn-out mother, among the ranks of women submerged and knowing amid their biology. In another tale, a man tracks down the now matronly woman who flirted with him when he was a blushing 13-year-old on a seaside holiday with his family 25 years before. Hadley's eerie, knowing portrayals speak to the heart as much as the mind. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There is a lot of mileage in the "weirdness" of the quantum world, and it often leads to confusion and, frankly, bad science. <b><i>The Quantum Universe</i></b> cuts through the Wu Li and asks what observations of the natural world made it necessary, how it was constructed, and why we are confident that, for all its apparent strangeness, it is a good theory.<br><br>The quantum mechanics of <b><i>The Quantum Universe</i></b> provide a concrete model of nature that is comparable in its essence to Newton's laws of motion, Maxwell's theory of electricity and magnetism, and Einstein's theory of relativity.<br><br></p><p><b>Brian Cox</b> is a professor of particle physics at the University of Manchester.

According to the American Homebrewers Association, there are currently 1.2 million home brewers in the country, and their numbers keep rising. Tired of the stale ale, bland beer and lackadaisical lagers mass-produced by the commercial labels, Americans are discovering the many advantages of brewing their own batch of that beloved beverage: superior aroma, color, body and flavor. <p> For both amateur alchemists eager to tap into this burgeoning field and seasoned zymurgists looking to improve their brews, The Brewmaster's Bible is the ultimate resource. Its features include: Updated data on liquid yeasts, which have become a hot topic for brewers; 30 recipes in each of the classic beer styles of Germany, Belgium, Britain and the U.S.; extensive profiles of grains, malts, adjuncts, additives and sanitizers; recipe formulation charts in an easy-to-read spreadsheet format; detailed water analyses for more than 25 cities and 6 bottled waters; directories to hundreds of shops; and much more.</p></p><p>Stephen Snyder is a contributor to America's largest beer newspaper, <em>Ale Street News.</em> He lives in Perkinsville, VT.<p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><br>An Introduction to Brewing <br><br>Your First Batch<br>As we discussed earlier, brewing from malt extract, especially malt extract syrup in a can, is how most of us began as homebrewers because it is the simplest, fastest, and most reliable way to make great beer. Using a simple malt extract-based recipe you will learn to make a terrific homebrewed beer with a classic American microbrewery taste that will be ready to drink in just three weeks. After you've tasted your first homebrew you'll quickly gain the confidence to brew again and no doubt be fired with a zeal to brew and learn as much as you can. Brew a few batches of this or some of the simpler recipes to follow, then branch out into some of the other styles. You'll be surprised at how fun this turns out to be and perhaps a little nervous about how enthusiastic you get about your new hobby. Don't be alarmed, you're just feeling the excitement that has captivated brewers for at least ten thousand years<br><br>Equipment You Will Need<br>Below are the essential pieces of equipment needed for homebrewing. Most of these common items you already have around your kitchen and can be employed in your brewery. However, it is a good practice to either buy new equipment or to relegate utensils you have to the exclusive use of your brewery. Keeping the things you use in brewing away from everyday kitchen duty will help keep them clean, grease-free, easily sanitized, and in good shape for years to come. Items specifically intended for brewing such as a bottling bucket or a hydrometer should be purchased from a homebrew supply store. There are over one thousand of these stores in the United States, and they can provide complete setups for beginning brewers, usually for much less than if you bought the pieces separately. A list of several good home-brew supply shops can be found beginning on page 357.<br><br>Brewing Equipment You Will Need<br>One large brew kettle. This will be used to boil the wort (it's not beer until it is fermented) and should be a twenty- to thirty-two-quart stockpot made of stainless steel or enamel. This needs to be physically clean but does not need to be sanitized, since you will be boiling in it for an hour.<br>Two hop bags. These will hold your two portions of hops in the boiling. They can be nylon or muslin bags purchased from a homebrew supply shop or simply pieces of cheesecloth tied around the hops with a piece of twine.<br>Sanitizing solution. In a new plastic bucket, prepare several gallons of sanitizing solution according to the instructions for the product you have chosen, or simply mix five teaspoons of bleach and five gallons of cold water in your primary fermenter. It is helpful to reserve a few pints of this solution in a measuring cup or glass jar in case you need to resanitize equipment sometime during the brewing process.<br>One primary fermenter with lid. Homebrewers have used everything from stockpots to plastic garbage pails to ferment their beer over the years, but I would recommend purchasing a new, 6.5-7.5-gallon "food-grade" plastic fermenter or a 6-gallon glass carboy. Although food-grade plastic, unlike glass, is porous enough to allow air to enter the beer over an extended time, it is significantly cheaper and can confidently be used for the short period needed for a primary ferment. If you do use a carboy, make sure there is plenty of "head space," the open area above the beer, to allow for the foaming that occurs during fermentation.<br>Airlock. These come in a variety of designs, but all are basically one-way valves created when you add a little water. Airlocks allow the escape of CO2 from the fermenter but don't allow airborne beer-spoiling microorganisms to enter from the outside.<br>Floating thermometer. You will use this to read the temperature of your wort when you take your specific gravity readings. This can be any type of immersible thermometer for kitchen use such as a candy thermometer but should be able to read temperatures between 60* and 212*F.<br>Hydrometer. These are often called "triple-scale" hydrometers because they have three different scales of measurement on them. One is to measure liquid density with the specific gravity scale; one is to measure the percentage of sugar in the solution with the Balling scale; and the third is calibrated to measure the potential alcohol that will exist in your beer. The hydrometer is one item that you will probably not have lying around the house and will need to purchase from a homebrew supply shop. Your hydrometer is most likely set to measure accurately at 60*F. By measuring the wort temperature with your floating thermometer and adjusting for temperature variances from 60* using the chart on page 354, you will be able to measure the original gravity and eventually how strong your beer will be.<br>Two long-handled spoons. A long wooden spoon is ideal for stirring your boiling wort; a long plastic or stainless-steel spoon that can be easily sanitized is ideal for stirring in your yeast and aerating the wort after it is cooled.<br>Two measuring cups. These are always handy to have around to hold spoons, thermometers, and various brewing gadgets. One will be used later to draw a sample of your wort for testing.<br>One egg timer. This will be used to time your boil and the addition of your hops.<br></p></p><h2>The Little Book of Big Lies: A Journey into Inner Fitness</h2><p><p><strong>An inspiring and illuminating guide to true self care, from the sage teacher and breakout star of the critically acclaimed drama, <em>Queen Sugar</em>, from Executive Producers Oprah Winfrey and Ava DuVernay for OWN.</strong></p><p><strong>Featured on <em>Essence Magazine's </em>Culture List<br></strong><br>In all your years of schooling, did you ever take a single class that explained how to navigate the hurt, drama, and fear that come with living?

Carolyn lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Visit her at readcarolyn.com.Gr 6 Up&#x2014;Margaret Bourke-White knew from an early age that she was unlike her peers, who, in the first decades of the 20th century, dreamed mostly of marriage and lives as homemakers. But Bourke-White had something different in mind: a career as a photographer. With very little money or encouragement, she progressed toward her goal and met benevolent people along the way who believed in her abilities. Her perseverance eventually paid off; she landed the first cover of Life magazine and traveled far and wide (Russia, the Arctic Circle) for assignments. Based on the life of the pioneering photographer, this docunovel ends as Bourke-White becomes the first female war correspondent during World War II, but her story continues in an appended author's note, which highlights further professional achievements. Though the dialogue is occasionally stilted and the descriptions of Bourke-White's accomplishments are sometimes dry, Meyer has clearly done her research, and she effectively draws from the facts of Bourke-White's life to create an absorbing narrative that conveys not only a strong sense of the individual but also of the larger societal context of the times. Meyer ably conveys the photographer's grit, gumption, and resourcefulness, coupled with an unparalleled work ethic and a determination to make it in a man's world during a time when women were just gaining the right to vote. VERDICT A good choice for curricular connections as well as for personal reading, this compelling offering may inspire readers to follow their dreams.&#x2014;Melissa Kazan, Horace Mann School, NY</p><h2>Introduction to World Christian History</h2><p>Christianity is a global faith. Today, people are increasingly aware that Christianity extends far beyond Europe and North America, permeating the Eastern and Southern hemispheres. What we may know less well is that Christianity has always been a global faith. A vast untold story waits to be heard beyond the familiar tale of how the Christian faith spread across Europe. Not only was Jesus born in Asia, but in the early years of the church Christianity found fertile soil in Africa and soon extended to East Asia as well. In this brief introduction to world Christian history, Derek Cooper explores the development of Christianity across time and the continents. Guiding readers to places such as Iraq, Ethiopia and India, Scandinavia, Brazil and Oceania, he reveals the fascinating&#x2015;and often surprising&#x2015;history of the church.</p><p>Derek Cooper (PhD, The Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia) is associate professor of world Christian history at Biblical Theological Seminary. He is the author of several books, including <em>Exploring Church History</em> and <em>Christianity and World Religions: An Introduction to the World's Major Faiths</em>, and he is the coeditor of the Reformation Commentary on Scripture volume on <em>1-2 Samuel, 1-2 Kings, 1-2 Chronicles</em>."Derek Cooper's <em>Introduction to World Christian History</em> (2016) is a good, tightly written history that shows the importance of Asia and Africa in Christianity's first 14 centuries." (Marvin Olasky, World Magazine, Sept. 17, 2016)<br><br>"Cooper's writing is engaging, and his chapter overviews and 'trail markers' help readers with uncommon terms and concepts. This is a valuable work for nonspecialists and scholars alike." (Publishers Weekly, May 9, 2016)<br><br>"The challenge for those writing a book on this topic is negotiating the question of breadth and depth. How broad should it be, and how deep can one go without risking a superficial overview or selective analysis? To the author's credit he dexterously steers through these challenges and provides us with a work that engages and interacts with the range and diversity of the living realities of the Christian faith in various regions of the world, opening up entryways to wonder at the global expressions of Christianity." (J. Jayakiran Sebastian, dean and H. George Anderson Professor of Mission and Cultures, Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia)<br><br>"Derek Cooper's <em>Introduction to World Christian History</em> is a welcome contribution to the field. This accessible and informative historical narrative introduces the reader to the broad, diverse and far-reaching story of Christianity as it 'blows where it wills' from the first through the twenty-first century. In the end, the reader is left with little doubt that Christianity was and is a worldwide movement." (Jennifer Powell McNutt, associate professor of theology and history of Christianity, Wheaton College)<br><br>"A welcome addition to the ever-expanding scholarship in the field of world Christianity studies, Derek Cooper's book helps to rewrite our traditional Western understanding of church history and course-correct away from North Atlantic&#x2013;centrism. Cooper gently leads us away from our particular tendencies to see and tell only our own stories toward a broader canvas of the 'great cloud of witnesses' that came before us and has not had its time in the spotlight." (Allen Yeh, associate professor of intercultural studies and missiology, Cook School of Intercultural Studies, Biola University)<br><br>"Derek Cooper's helpful volume reminds us that the global complexity of Christianity today is the fruit of a Christian past that is equally multifaceted and complex. His fresh rendering of that past emphasizes overlooked histories of Christians in Africa, Asia and other regions of the world, and downplays some familiar tales from the West that now seem quite parochial when viewed in global perspective. Cooper's kaleidoscopic account provides many different angles from which to view Christian similarities and differences, and readers will be enriched by the breadth and magnanimity of his presentation." (Douglas Jacobsen, author of Global Gospel)<br><br>"It is widely known that today the majority of Christians live in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Less appreciated is Christianity's thriving presence in these locations for many centuries. In this book Cooper reintroduces us to the global story of Christianity&#x2015;relocating the center of the Christian narrative to the Global South, joining an emerging chorus of scholars who are challenging the status quo of Christianity as a Western religion."

The Significance of Architecture</b><br><br> 1.<br><br> A terraced house on a tree-lined street. Earlier today, the house rang with the sound of children's cries and adult voices, but since the last occupant took off (with her satchel) a few hours ago, it has been left to sample the morning by itself. The sun has risen over the gables of the buildings opposite and now washes through the ground- floor windows, painting the interior walls a buttery yellow and warming the grainy-red brick fa�ade. Within shafts of sunlight, platelets of dust move as if in obedience to the rhythms of a silent waltz. From the hallway, the low murmur of accelerating traffic can be detected a few blocks away. Occasionally, the letter-box opens with a rasp to admit a plaintive leaflet.<br><br> The house gives signs of enjoying the emptiness. It is rearranging itself after the night, clearing its pipes and cracking its joints. This dignified and seasoned creature, with its coppery veins and wooden feet nestled in a bed of clay, has endured much: balls bounced against its garden flanks, doors slammed in rage, headstands attempted along its corridors, the weight and sighs of electrical equipment and the probings of inexperienced plumbers into its innards. A family of four shelters in it, joined by a colony of ants around the foundations and, in spring time, by broods of robins in the chimney stack. It also lends a shoulder to a frail (or just indolent) sweet-pea which leans against the garden wall, indulging the peripatetic courtship of a circle of bees.<br><br> The house has grown into a knowledgeable witness. It has been party to early seductions, it has watched homework being written, it has observed swaddled babies freshly arrived from hospital, it has been surprised in the middle of the night by whispered conferences in the kitchen. It has experienced winter evenings when its windows were as cold as bags of frozen peas and midsummer dusks when its brick walls held the warmth of newly baked bread.<br><br> It has provided not only physical but also psychological sanctuary. It has been a guardian of identity. Over the years, its owners have returned from periods away and, on looking around them, remembered who they were. The flagstones on the ground floor speak of serenity and aged grace, while the regularity of the kitchen cabinets offers a model of unintimidating order and discipline. The dining table, with its waxy tablecloth printed with large buttercups, suggests a burst of playfulness which is thrown into relief by a sterner concrete wall nearby. Along the stairs, small still-lives of eggs and lemons draw attention to the intricacy and beauty of everyday things. On a ledge beneath a window, a glass jar of cornflowers helps to resist the pull towards dejection. On the upper floor, a narrow empty room allows space for restorative thoughts to hatch, its skylight giving out onto impatient clouds migrating rapidly over cranes and chimney pots.<br><br> Although this house may lack solutions to a great many of its occupants' ills, its rooms nevertheless give evidence of a happiness to which architecture has made its distinctive contribution.<br><br> 2.<br><br> Yet a concern for architecture has never been free from a degree of suspicion. Doubts have been raised about the subject's seriousness, its moral worth and its cost. A thought-provoking number of the world's most intelligent people have disdained any interest in decoration and design, equating contentment with discarnate and invisible matters instead.<br><br> The Ancient Greek Stoic philosopher Epictetus is said to have demanded of a heart-broken friend whose house had burnt to the ground, 'If you really understand what governs the universe, how can you yearn for bits of stone and pretty rock?' (It is unclear how much longer the friendship lasted.) Legend recounts that after hearing the voice of God, the Christian hermit Alexandra sold her house, shut herself in a tomb and never looked at the outside world again, while her fellow hermit Paul of Scete slept on a blanket on the floor of a windowless mud hut and recited 300 prayers every day, suffering only when he heard of another holy man who had managed 700 and slept in a coffin.<br><br> Such austerity has been a historical constant. In the spring of 1137 the Cistercian monk St Bernard of Clairvaux travelled all the way around Lake Geneva without noticing it was even there. Likewise, after four years in his monastery, St Bernard could not report whether the dining area had a vaulted ceiling (it does) or how many windows there were in the sanctuary of his church (three). On a visit to the Charterhouse of Dauphin�, St Bernard astonished his hosts by arriving on a magnificent white horse diametrically opposed to the ascetic values he professed, but he explained that he had borrowed the animal from a wealthy uncle and had simply failed to register its appearance on a four-day journey across France.<br><br> 3.<br><br> Nevertheless, such determined efforts to scorn visual experience have always been matched by equally persistent attempts to mould the material world to graceful ends. People have strained their backs carving flowers into their roof beams and their eyesight embroidering animals onto their tablecloths. They have given up weekends to hide unsightly cables behind ledges. They have thought carefully about appropriate kitchen work-surfaces. They have imagined living in unattainably expensive houses pictured in magazines and then felt sad, as one does on passing an attractive stranger in a crowded street.<br><br> We seem divided between an urge to override our senses and numb ourselves to our settings and a contradictory impulse to acknowledge the extent to which our identities are indelibly connected to, and will shift along with, our locations. An ugly room can coagulate any loose suspicions as to the incompleteness of life, while a sun-lit one set with honey-coloured limestone tiles can lend support to whatever is most hopeful within us.<br><br> Belief in the significance of architecture is premised on the notion that we are, for better or for worse, different people in different places - and on the conviction that it is architecture's task to render vivid to us who we might ideally be.<br><br> 4.<br><br> We are sometimes eager to celebrate the influence of our surroundings. In the living room of a house in the Czech Republic, we see an example of how walls, chairs and floors can combine to create an atmosphere in which the best sides of us are offered the opportunity to flourish. We accept with gratitude the power that a single room can possess.<br><br> But sensitivity to architecture also has its more problematic aspects. If one room can alter how we feel, if our happiness can hang on the colour of the walls or the shape of a door, what will happen to us in most of the places we are forced to look at and inhabit? What will we experience in a house with prison-like windows, stained carpet tiles and plastic curtains?<br><br> It is to prevent the possibility of permanent anguish that we can be led to shut our eyes to most of what is around us, for we are never far from damp stains and cracked ceilings, shattered cities and rusting dockyards. We can't remain sensitive indefinitely to environments which we don't have the means to alter for the good - and end up as conscious as we can afford to be. Echoing the attitude of Stoic philosophers or St Bernard around Lake Geneva, we may find ourselves arguing that, ultimately, it doesn't much matter what buildings look like, what is on the ceiling or how the wall is treated - professions of detachment that stem not so much from an insensitivity to beauty as from a desire to deflect the sadness we would face if we left ourselves open to all of beauty's many absences.<br><br> 5.<br><br> There is no shortage of reasons to be suspicious of the ambition to create great architecture. Buildings rarely make palpable the efforts that their construction demands. They are coyly silent about the bankruptcies, the delays, the fear and the dust that they impose. A nonchalant appearance is a frequent feature of their charm. It is only when we try our own hand at construction that we are initiated into the torments associated with persuading materials and other humans to cooperate with our designs, with ensuring that two pieces of glass will be joined in a neat line, that a lamp will hang symmetrically over the stairs, that a boiler will light up when it should or that concrete pillars will marry a roof without complaint.<br><br> Even when we have attained our goals, our buildings have a grievous tendency to fall apart again with precipitate speed. It can be hard to walk into a freshly decorated house without feeling preemptively sad at the decay impatiently waiting to begin: how soon the walls will crack, the white cupboards will yellow and the carpets stain. The ruins of the Ancient World offer a mocking lesson for anyone waiting for builders to finish their work. How proud the householders of Pompeii must have been.<br><br> In his essay 'On Transience' (1916) Sigmund Freud recalled a walk he took in the Dolomite Mountains with the poet Rainer Maria Rilke. It was an exquisite summer's day; the flowers were in bloom and brightly coloured butterflies danced above the meadows. The psychoanalyst was glad to be outdoors (it had been raining all week), but his companion walked with his head bowed, his eyes fixed on the ground, and remained taciturn throughout the excursion. It wasn't that Rilke was oblivious to the beauty around him; he simply could not overlook how impermanent everything was. In Freud's words, he was unable to forget 'that all this beauty was fated to extinction, that it would vanish when winter came, like all human beauty and all the beauty that men have created or may create'.<br><br> Freud was unsympathetic; for him, the capacity to love anything attractive, however fragile it might be, was a hallmark of psychological health. But Rilke's stance, though inconvenient, helpfully emphasises how it can be those most in thrall to beauty who will be especially aware of, and saddened by, its ephemeral character. Such melancholic enthusiasts will see the moth hole beneath the curtain swatch and the ruin beneath the plan. They may at the last moment cancel an appointment with an estate agent, having realised that the house under offer, as well as the city and even civilisation itself, will soon enough be reduced to fragments of shattered brick over which cockroaches will triumphantly crawl. They may prefer to rent a room or live in a barrel out of a reluctance to contemplate the slow disintegration of the objects of their love.<br><br> At its apex, a passion for architecture may turn us into aesthetes, eccentric figures who must watch over their houses with the vigilance of museum guards, patrolling their rooms in search of stains, a damp cloth or sponge in hand. Aesthetes will have no choice but to forgo the company of small children and, during dinner with friends, will have to ignore the conversation in order to focus on whether someone might lean back and inadvertently leave a head-shaped imprint on the wall.<br><br> It would be pleasant to refuse in a muscular spirit to lend stray blemishes genuine significance. However, aesthetes force us to consider whether happiness may not sometimes turn on the presence or absence of a fingerprint, whether in certain situations beauty and ugliness may not lie only a few millimetres apart, whether a single mark might not wreck a wall or an errant brush stroke undo a landscape painting. We should thank these sensitive spirits for pointing us with theatrical honesty towards the possibility of a genuine antithesis between competing values: for example, an attachment to beautiful architecture and the pursuit of an exuberant and affectionate family life.<br><br> How wise were the ancient philosophers in suggesting that we exclude from our vision of contentment anything that might one day be covered by lava or blow down in a hurricane, succumb to a chocolate smear or absorb a wine stain.<br><br> 6.<br><br> Architecture is perplexing, too, in how inconsistent is its capacity to generate the happiness on which its claim to our attention is founded. While an attractive building may on occasion flatter an ascending mood, there will be times when the most congenial of locations will be unable to dislodge our sadness or misanthropy.<br><br> We can feel anxious and envious even though the floor we're standing on has been imported from a remote quarry, and finely sculpted window frames have been painted a soothing grey. Our inner metronome can be unimpressed by the efforts of workmen to create a fountain or nurture a symmetrical line of oak trees. We can fall into a petty argument which ends in threats of divorce in a building by Geoffrey Bawa or Louis Kahn. Houses can invite us to join them in a mood which we find ourselves incapable of summoning. The noblest architecture can sometimes do less for us than a siesta or an aspirin.<br><br> Those who have made architectural beauty their life's work know only too well how futile their efforts can prove. After an exhaustive study of the buildings of Venice, in a moment of depressive lucidity, John Ruskin acknowledged that few Venetians in fact seemed elevated by their city, perhaps the most beautiful urban tapestry in the world. Alongside St Mark's Church (described by Ruskin in The Stones of Venice as 'a Book of Common Prayer, a vast illuminated missal, bound with alabaster instead of parchment, studded with porphyry pillars instead of jewels, and written within and without in letters of enamel and gold'), they sat in caf�s, read the papers, sunbathed, bickered and stole from one another as, high on the church's roof, unobserved, 'the images of Christ and His angels looked down upon them.'<br><br> Endowed with a power that is as unreliable as it often is inexpressible, architecture will always compete poorly with utilitarian demands for humanity's resources. How hard it is to make a case for the cost of tearing down and rebuilding a mean but serviceable street. How awkward to have to defend, in the face of more tangible needs, the benefits of realigning a crooked lamppost or replacing an ill-matched window frame. Beautiful architecture has none of the unambiguous advantages of a vaccine or a bowl of rice. Its construction will hence never be raised to a dominant political priority, for even if the whole of the man-made world could, through relentless effort and sacrifice, be modelled to rival St Mark's Square, even if we could spend the rest of our lives in the Villa Rotonda or the Glass House, we would still often be in a bad mood.<br><br> 7.<br><br> Not only do beautiful houses falter as guarantors of happiness, they can also be accused of failing to improve the characters of those who live in them.<br><br> It seems reasonable to suppose that people will possess some of the qualities of the buildings they are drawn to: to expect that if they are alive to the charm of an ancient farmhouse with walls made of irregular chiselled stones set in light mortar.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Working with Anger in Internal Family Systems Therapy</h2><p>Anger can arise in various ways in Internal Family Systems Therapy (IFS), depending on which part holds the anger, what function the anger serves, and whether the anger is disowned.

The last stop on my tour. I shoved open the door to my private suite, and Kane, my bodyguard, closed it firmly behind me. The screaming on the other side of the door had only made my head hurt. This had been fun once. Now all I could think about was getting away from it. The girls. The relentless schedule. The lack of sleep and the pressure. I wanted to be someone else. Anywhere else.<br> <br>The door opened and quickly closed behind me. I sank down onto the black leather sectional sofa and watched my younger brother, Jason, as he grinned at me with two beers in his hands.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s over,&#x201d; he announced. Only Jason understood my feelings lately. He&#x2019;d been with me through this crazy ride. He saw my parents&#x2019; need to push me and my need to push back. He was my best friend. My only friend, really. I gave up trying to figure out who liked me for my money and fame a long time ago. It was pointless.<br> <br>Jason handed me a beer and sat down on the sofa. &#x201c;You killed it out there. The place was insane. No one would ever guess you were looking forward to running off to Alabama in the morning to hide away all summer.&#x201d;<br> <br>My agent, Marco, had told my parents about the private island on the Alabama coast. They were so ready to have somewhere other than our house in LA that they&#x2019;d jumped at the idea.<br> <br>Going back to my hometown&#x2014;Austin, Texas&#x2014;hadn&#x2019;t been something they wanted to do. Too many people knew who we were.<br> <br>The security Sea Breeze offered had always allowed me the freedom I&#x2019;d lost when the world had embraced me. For a few weeks every summer we were a family again. I was just another guy, and I could walk out to the water and enjoy it without cameras and fans. No autographs. Just peace. Tomorrow we were headed back there. It was our summer break. But this year I was staying the whole damn summer. I didn&#x2019;t care what my mother or my agent thought I should do. I was hiding out for three months, and they could all kiss Marco&#x2019;s ass. What had started as my mother&#x2019;s insistence that we spend the summers together in Alabama had become mine. I needed time with just them. I rarely saw them the rest of the year. It was the only house we had to call ours. I had my house in LA, and my parents and Jason had theirs.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re coming down, right?&#x201d; I asked him.<br> <br>Jason nodded. &#x201c;Yeah. I&#x2019;ll be there, but not tomorrow. I need a few days. Mom and I had an argument about college. I want to give it a few days before I face her again. She&#x2019;s driving me crazy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Our mother was a micromanager when it came to our lives. &#x201c;Good idea. I&#x2019;ll talk to her. Maybe I can get her to back off.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jason laid his head back on the leather. &#x201c;Good luck. She&#x2019;s on a mission to make me miserable.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lately I felt like she was doing the same to me. I no longer lived with her. I lived independently. I was the one who paid her bills. Why she thought she could still tell me what to do was beyond me. But she did. She always thought she knew what was best. I was done with that, and so was Jason. I&#x2019;d talk to her, all right. She needed to remember who was actually in control here and back off.<br> <br>&#x201c;Take a few days. Enjoy yourself. Let me prep Mom for the fact that I&#x2019;m not going to allow her to control your life. Then come south,&#x201d; I told him before taking a long drink of my beer.<br> SADIE<p></p> <br>&#x201c;Mom, are you going to work today?&#x201d; I rolled my eyes at my very pregnant mother, who lay sprawled out on her bed in her panties and bra. Pregnancy made Jessica an even bigger drama queen than before having unsafe sex with another loser.<br> <br>She moaned and covered her head with a pillow. &#x201c;I feel awful, Sadie. You just go on without me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;d seen this coming a mile away before school even let out. The last day of school landed yesterday, but instead of being able to go out and be a normal teenager, I was expected to make the money for us. It was almost as if Jessica had planned on me working in her place all along.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t just go to your workplace and take your position. Haven&#x2019;t you explained the situation to them? They won&#x2019;t be okay with your seventeen-year-old daughter doing your job.&#x201d;<br> <br>She pulled the pillow from her face and tossed me a sulk she&#x2019;d perfected years ago. &#x201c;Sadie, I can&#x2019;t continue cleaning house with my stomach the size of a beach ball. I&#x2019;m so hot and tired. I need you to help me. You can do it. You always figure stuff out.&#x201d;<br> <br>I walked over to the air conditioner and turned it off. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d stop running it at a continuous sixty-eight degrees, we might be able to get by on less money. Do you have any idea how much it costs to run a window unit all day long?&#x201d; I knew she didn&#x2019;t know, nor did she care, but I still asked.<br> <br>She grimaced and sat up. &#x201c;Do you have any idea how hot I am with all this extra weight?&#x201d; she shot back at me.<br> <br>It took all my restraint to keep from reminding her that she got this way because she hadn&#x2019;t used a condom. I bought them for her and made sure her purse always contained several. I even reminded her before she went out on dates.<br> <br>Remembering who the adult was in our relationship could be difficult at times. Most of the time it seemed to me our roles were reversed. Being the adult, however, did not mean she made smart decisions, because Jessica simply did not know how to be responsible.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re hot, but we can&#x2019;t spend every dime we make on the air conditioner,&#x201d; I reminded her.<br> <br>She sighed and flopped back down on the bed. &#x201c;Whatever,&#x201d; she grumbled.<br> <br>I walked over to her purse and opened it up. &#x201c;All right, I&#x2019;m going to go to your job today, by myself, and I hope they allow me inside the gate. If this doesn&#x2019;t work, don&#x2019;t say I didn&#x2019;t warn you. All I am qualified for is minimum-wage jobs, which won&#x2019;t pay our bills. If you would come with me, I would have a better chance of landing this position.&#x201d; I knew as I spoke the words that I&#x2019;d already been tuned out. At least she had managed to keep the job for two months.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sadie, you and I both know you can handle it by yourself.&#x201d;<br> <br>I sighed in defeat and left her there. She would go back to sleep as soon as I left. I wanted to be mad at her, but seeing her so big made me pity her instead. She wasn&#x2019;t the best mom in the world, but she did belong to me. After I got my clothes on, I walked past her room and peeked through the door. She softly snored with the window unit once again cranked to sixty-eight degrees. I thought about turning it off, but changed my mind. The apartment already felt warm, and the day would only get hotter.<br> <br>I stepped outside and got on my bike. It took me thirty minutes to get to the bridge. The bridge would take me from Sea Breeze, Alabama, onto the exclusive island that was connected to it. The island wasn&#x2019;t where the locals lived, but where the wealthy came for the summer. Jessica had managed to snag a job as a domestic servant at one of the houses that employed full staffs. The pay was twelve dollars an hour. I prayed I would be able to take over her position without a hitch.<br> <br>I found the address on her employee card I&#x2019;d retrieved from her purse. My chances of getting this job were slim. The farther I pedaled onto the island, the larger and more extravagant the houses became. The address of my mother&#x2019;s place of employment was coming up. She, of course, had to work at the most extravagant house on the block, not to mention the very last one before the beach. I pulled up to a large ornate iron gate and handed Jessica&#x2019;s ID card to the guy working admittance. He frowned and gazed down at me. I handed him my driver&#x2019;s license.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Jessica&#x2019;s White&#x2019;s daughter. She&#x2019;s sick, and I&#x2019;m supposed to work for her today.&#x201d;<br> <br>He continued to frown while he picked up a phone and called someone. That wasn&#x2019;t a good thing, considering no one here knew I was coming in her place. For good. Two large men appeared and walked up to me. Both sported dark sunglasses and looked like they should be wearing football uniforms and playing on NFL teams instead of black suits.<br> <br>&#x201c;Miss White, can we see your bag, please,&#x201d; one of them said, rather than asked, while the other one took it off my shoulder.<br> <br>I swallowed and fought the urge to shudder. They were big and intimidating and didn&#x2019;t appear to trust me. I wondered if I seemed dangerous to them, all five feet six inches of me. I glanced down at my skimpy white shorts and purple tank top and wondered if they&#x2019;d considered the fact that it would be impossible to hide weapons in this outfit. I thought it somewhat strange that the two big guys were reluctant to let me in. Even if I happened to be a threat, I do believe either one of them could have taken me blindfolded with his hands tied behind his back. The image popped into my mind and made me want to laugh. I bit my bottom lip and waited to see if dangerous little me would be allowed entrance through the bigger-than-life iron gates.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re free to enter, Miss White. Please take the servants&#x2019; entrance to the left of the stone wall and report to the kitchen, where you will be instructed how to proceed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Who were these people who needed two men the size of Goliath to guard their entrance? I got back on my bike and rode through the now open gates. Once I made it around the corner, past lush palm trees and tropical gardens, I saw the house. It reminded me of houses on MTV Cribs. I never would&#x2019;ve guessed houses like this even existed in Alabama. I&#x2019;d been to Nashville once and seen houses similar in size, but nothing quite this spectacular.<br> <br>I composed myself and pushed my bike around the corner, trying to not stop and stare at the massive size of everything. I leaned my bike against a wall, out of sight. The entrance for the servants was designed to impress. At least twelve feet tall, the door was adorned with a beautifully engraved letter S. Not just tall, the door was really heavy, causing me to use all my strength to pull it open. I peeked inside the large entry hall and stepped into a small area with three different arched doorways ahead of me to choose from. Since I&#x2019;d never been here before, I didn&#x2019;t know where the kitchen might be located. I walked up to the first door on the right and looked through the opening. It appeared to be a large gathering room, but nothing fancy and no kitchen appliances, so I moved on to door number two, peeked inside, and found a large round table with people sitting around it. A large older lady stood in front of a stove unlike any I&#x2019;d ever seen in a house. It was something you&#x2019;d find in a restaurant.<br> <br>This had to be the place. I stepped through the arched opening.<br> <br>The lady standing noticed me and frowned. &#x201c;Can I help you?&#x201d; she asked in a sharp, authoritative tone, though she kind of reminded me of Aunt Bee from The Andy Griffith Show.<br> <br>I smiled, and the heat rose, threatening to spike out the top of my head as I watched all the people in the room turn to face me. I hated attention and did whatever I could to draw little to myself. Even though it seemed to be getting harder the older I got. As much as possible, I tried to avoid situations that encouraged other people to speak to me. It&#x2019;s not that I&#x2019;m a recluse; it&#x2019;s just the fact that I have a lot of responsibility. I figured out early in life that friendships would never work for me. I&#x2019;m too busy taking care of my mom. So I&#x2019;ve perfected the art of being uninteresting.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, uh, yes, I was told to report to the kitchen for further instructions.&#x201d; I quietly cleared my voice and waited.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t like the once-over the lady gave me, but since I was here, I had no choice but to stay.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know I sure didn&#x2019;t hire you. Who told you to come here?&#x201d;<br> <br>I hated all those eyes on me and wished Jessica hadn&#x2019;t been so stubborn. I needed her here, at least for today. Why did she always do these things to me?<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Sadie White, Jessica White&#x2019;s daughter. She&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wasn&#x2019;t well today, so I am here to work for her. I&#x2019;m&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. uh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. supposed to be working with her this summer.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wished I didn&#x2019;t sound so nervous, but the people stared. The lady up front frowned much like the way Aunt Bee looked when someone made her angry. It was tempting to turn and run.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jessica didn&#x2019;t ask about you helping her this summer, and I don&#x2019;t hire kids. It ain&#x2019;t a good idea with the family comin&#x2019; down for the whole summer. Maybe during the fall when they leave we can give you a try.&#x201d;<br> <br>My nervousness from being the center of attention immediately disappeared, and I panicked at the thought of our losing this income we so desperately needed. If my mom found out I couldn&#x2019;t work for her, she would quit. I pulled my grown-up voice out of the closet and decided I needed to show this lady I could do the job better than anyone else.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can understand your concern. However, if you would give me a chance, I can and will show you I&#x2019;m an asset. I&#x2019;ll never be late to work and will always complete the jobs assigned to me. Please, just a chance.&#x201d;<br> <br>The lady glanced down at someone at the table as if to get an opinion. She moved her eyes back up to me, and I could see I&#x2019;d broken through her resolve. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Ms. Mary, and I&#x2019;m in charge of the household staff and I run the kitchen. You impress me and you have the job. Okay, Sadie White, your chance starts now. I&#x2019;m gonna team you up with Fran here, who has been working in this home as long as I have. She&#x2019;ll instruct you and report back to me. I will have you an answer at the end of the day. Here is your trial, Miss White. I suggest you don&#x2019;t blow it.&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded and smiled over at Fran, who was now standing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Follow me,&#x201d; the tall, skinny redhead who appeared to be at least sixty-five years old said before she turned and left the room.<br> <br>I did as instructed without making eye contact with any of the others. I had a job to save.<br> <br>Fran walked me down a hallway and past several doors. We stopped, opened one, and stepped inside. The room contained shelves of books from the floor to the ceiling. Large dark-brown leather chairs were scattered around the room. None faced any of the others or looked to be used for any type of visiting or socializing. The room was clearly set up to be a library. A place where people could come, find a book, and lose themselves in one of the large cushy chairs.<br> <br>Fran swung her arm out in front of her, gesturing to the room with a bit of flair. It surprised me coming from an older lady. &#x201c;This is Mrs. Stone&#x2019;s favorite spot. It&#x2019;s been closed off all year. You will dust the books and shelves, clean the leather with the special cleaner, and clean the windows. Vacuum the drapes; clean and wax the floors. This room must shine. Mrs. Stone likes things perfect in her sanctuary. I will come get you at lunchtime, and we will dine in the kitchen.&#x201d;<br> <br>She walked to the door, and I heard her thank someone. She stepped back inside, pulling a cart full of cleaning supplies. &#x201c;This will have everything you need. Be careful with all framed artwork and sculptures. I warn you, everything in this house is very valuable and must be treated with the utmost care. Now, I expect you to work hard and not waste any time with foolishness.&#x201d; The tight-faced Fran left the room.<br> <br>I circled around, taking in the extravagance of my surroundings. The room wasn&#x2019;t really big; it just seemed full. I could clean this. I hadn&#x2019;t been asked to do anything impossible. I went for the dusting supplies and headed to the ladder connected to the bookshelves. I might as well start at the top, since dust falls.<br> <br>I managed to get everything dusted and the windows cleaned before Fran returned to get me for lunch.

While living on the eastern slope of Telegraph Hill, he made a magical discovery: a flock of wild parrots. In this unforgettable story, Bittner recounts how he became fascinated by the birds and patiently developed friendships with them that would last more than six years.

Do you put it under your pillow and wait for the tooth fairy? Not if you live in Botswana! In Botswana, children throw their teeth onto the roof. In Afghanistan they drop their teeth down mouse holes, and in Egypt they fling their teeth at the sun! Travel around the world and discover the surprising things children do when they lose a tooth. Selby B. Beeler spent years collecting traditions from every corner of the globe for this whimsical book, and illustrator G. Brian Karas adds to the fun, filling every page with humorous detail. He perfectly captures the excitement and pride that children experience when a tooth falls out.<br><br>This title has been selected as a Common Core Text Exemplar (Grades 2-3, Informational Texts)</p><p>Eat your heart out, tooth fairy. According to the informal research of the author, the world is full of other, equally fascinating myths and traditions about what happens, or should be done, when those milk choppers part company with childish gums. If you come from Chile or Costa Rica, your parents will have the tooth made into a charm. If you're Venezuelan, you put the tooth under your pillow and hope that a mouse brings you money. (Oddly enough, mice, milk teeth, and money are associated all over the world.) Playful illustrations by G.

Social media apps, surveillance technologies, and the Internet of Things are all built in ways that make it hard to guard personal information. And the law says this is okay because it is up to users to protect themselves&#x2015;even when the odds are deliberately stacked against them.</p><p>In <i>Privacy&#x2019;s Blueprint,</i> Woodrow Hartzog pushes back against this state of affairs, arguing that the law should require software and hardware makers to respect privacy in the design of their products. Current legal doctrine treats technology as though it were value-neutral: only the user decides whether it functions for good or ill. But this is not so. As Hartzog explains, popular digital tools are designed to expose people and manipulate users into disclosing personal information.</p><p>Against the often self-serving optimism of Silicon Valley and the inertia of tech evangelism, Hartzog contends that privacy gains will come from better rules for products, not users. The current model of regulating use fosters exploitation. <i>Privacy&#x2019;s Blueprint</i> aims to correct this by developing the theoretical underpinnings of a new kind of privacy law responsive to the way people actually perceive and use digital technologies. The law can demand encryption. It can prohibit malicious interfaces that deceive users and leave them vulnerable. It can require safeguards against abuses of biometric surveillance. It can, in short, make the technology itself worthy of our trust.</p></p><p>Woodrow Hartzog is Professor of Law and Computer Science at Northeastern University School of Law and College of Computer and Information Science.&#x201c;[A] smart new book...

[from] a rising star" (Junot D�az)</b><br><b></b><br><b></b><br><i>Karate Chop</i>, Dorthe Nors's acclaimed story collection, is the debut book in the collaboration between Graywolf Press and <i>A Public Space</i>. These fifteen compact stories are meticulously observed glimpses of everyday life that expose the ominous lurking under the ordinary. While his wife sleeps, a husband prowls the Internet, obsessed with female serial killers; a bureaucrat tries to reinvent himself, exposing goodness as artifice when he converts to Buddhism in search of power; a woman sits on the edge of the bed where her lover lies, attempting to locate a motive for his violence within her own self-doubt. Shifting between moments of violence (real and imagined) and mundane contemporary life, these stories encompass the complexity of human emotions, our capacity for cruelty as well as compassion. Not so much minimalist as stealthy, <i>Karate Chop</i> delivers its blows with an understatement that shows a master at work.</p></p><p><p><b>Dorthe Nors</b> is the author of five novels and the recipient of the Danish Arts Agency's Three Year Grant for "her unusual and extraordinary talent."

I guess Florence had never seen a man so big. Before she could say a word, he reached out and stuck his hand in the collar of her dress and ripped it down to her waist so that her breasts bounded out bare under the yellow light. We all scraped our chairs and stood up&#x2014;none of us had looked at Florence that way before, for all she was. The saloon was full because we watched the man coming for a long time before he pulled in, but there was no sound now.<br> &nbsp;<br> This town was in the Dakota Territory, and on three sides&#x2014;east, south, west&#x2014;there is nothing but miles of flats. That&#x2019;s how we could see him coming. Most times the dust on the horizon moved east to west&#x2014;wagon trains nicking the edge of the flats with their wheels and leaving a long dust turd lying on the rim of the earth. If a man rode toward us he made a fan in the air that got wider and wider. To the north were hills of rock and that was where the lodes were which gave an excuse for the town, although not a good one. Really there was no excuse for it except that people naturally come together.<br> &nbsp;<br> So by the time he walked into the Silver Sun a bunch of us were waiting to see who he was. It was foolish because in this country a man&#x2019;s pride is not to pay attention, and after he did that to the girl he turned around to grin at us and we looked away or coughed or sat down. Flo meanwhile couldn&#x2019;t believe what happened, she stood with her eyes wide and her mouth open. He took his hand off the bar and suddenly grabbed her wrist and twisted her arm around so that she turned and doubled over with the pain. Then, as if she was a pet bear, he walked her in front of him over to the stairs and up to a room on the second floor. After the door slammed we stood looking up and finally we heard Florence screaming and we wondered what kind of man it was who could make her scream.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jimmy Fee was the only child in town and when Flo was stumbling over her dress up the stairs, he ducked under the swinging doors and ran down the porch past the man&#x2019;s horse and across the street. Fee, his father, was a carpenter, he had built up both sides of the street almost without help. Fee was on a ladder fixing the eaves over the town stable.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pa,&#x201d; Jimmy called up to him, &#x201c;the man&#x2019;s got your Flo!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack Millay, the limping man with one arm, told me later he followed the boy across the street to fill Fee in on the details&#x2014;little Jimmy might not have made it clear that the customer was a Bad Man from Bodie. Fee came down the ladder, went around in back of his place down the street, and came out with a stout board. He was a short man, bald, thick in the neck and in the shoulders, and he was one of the few men I ever met who knew what life was about. I was standing by the window of the Silver Sun and when I saw Fee coming I got out of those doors fast. So did everyone there, even though the screaming had not stopped. By the time Fee walked in with his plank at the ready, the place was empty.<br> &nbsp;<br> We all stood scattered in the street waiting for something to happen. Avery, the fat barkeep, had brought a bottle with him and he tilted his head back and drank, standing out in the dirt with his white apron on and one hand on his hip. I had never seen Avery in sunlight before. The sun was on the western flats to about four o&#x2019;clock. There was no sound now from the saloon. The only horse tied up in front was the stranger&#x2019;s: a big ugly roan that didn&#x2019;t look like he expected water or a rub. Behind him in the dirt was a pile of new manure.<br> &nbsp;<br> We waited and then there was a noise from inside&#x2014;a clatter&#x2014;and that was all. After a while Fee came out of the Silver Sun with his cudgel and stood on the porch. He walked forward and missed the steps. The Bad Man&#x2019;s horse skittered aside and Fee tumbled down and landed on his knees in the manure. He got up with dung clinging to his britches and lurched on toward Ezra Maple, the Express Man, who said: &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t see.&#x201d; Ezra stepped aside as Fee staggered by him. The back of Fee&#x2019;s bald head was bashed and webbed with blood and he was holding his ears. Little Jimmy stood next to me watching his father go up the street. He ran after a few yards, then stopped, then ran after again. When he caught up to Fee he took his belt and together they walked into Fee&#x2019;s door.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nobody went back into the saloon, we were all reminded of business we had to do. When I got to my office door I glanced back and the only one still standing in the street was Avery, in his apron. I knew he&#x2019;d be the first over to see me and he was.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Blue, that gentleman&#x2019;s in my place, you got to get him out of there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I saw him pay you money Avery.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I got stock behind that bar, I got window glass in my windows, I got my grain and still in back. There&#x2019;s no telling what he&#x2019;ll do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;ll leave soon enough.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He cracked Fee&#x2019;s skull!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A fight&#x2019;s a fight, there&#x2019;s nothing I can do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Goddamnit!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well now Avery I&#x2019;m forty-nine years old.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Goddamnit!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I took my gun out of my drawer and shoved it over the desk toward fat Avery but he didn&#x2019;t take it. Instead he sat down on my cot and we waited together. About dusk Jimmy Fee came in and told me his father was bleeding at the mouth. I went out and found John Bear, the deaf-and-dumb Pawnee who served for our doctor, and we went over to Fee&#x2019;s place but Fee was already dead. The Indian shrugged and walked out and I was left to comfort the boy all night.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once, around midnight, when it got too cold for me, I walked back to my office to get a blanket. And on the way I sneaked across the street&#x2014;running where there was moonlight&#x2014;to peek into the window of the Silver Sun. The lights were still burning. Behind the bar, Florence, with her red hair unpinned to her shoulders, was crying and pouring herself a stiff one. I tapped on the window, but she knew Fee was dead and she wouldn&#x2019;t come out. I ran around back. The upstairs was dark and I could hear the Man from Bodie snoring.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I came West with the wagons, I was a young man with expectations of something, I don&#x2019;t know what, I tar-painted my name on a big rock by the Missouri trailside. But in time my expectations wore away with the weather, like my name had from that rock, and I learned it was enough to stay alive. Bad Men from Bodie weren&#x2019;t ordinary scoundrels, they came with the land, and you could no more cope with them than you could with dust or hailstones.<br> &nbsp;<br> I found twelve dollars in Fee&#x2019;s bureau when the sun came up and I gave them to Hausenfield, the German. Hausenfield owned a bathtub, he had brought it in his wagon all the way from St. Louis. At the beginning of each month Hausenfield would fill that tub with water from his well and sit right down in back of his house and wash. He also owned the stable.<br> &nbsp;<br> After I gave him the money he went into his stable and pushed out his wagon by the tongue and hitched up his mule and his grey. The wagon was an old stage with the windows boarded and the seats torn out. It was black, the one painted thing in town. He drove it over to Fee&#x2019;s door.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Put him in dere please.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack Millay, who was standing by with his one arm, helped me take Fee out and put him in the wagon.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have a casket Hausenfield?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He never build me vun. He said he would build ten for me, but he never build even vun.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I closed the door on Fee and the wagon creaked down the street and into the flats. It was cold and early but nearly everyone was out watching it go. A pickaxe clanked on top of the stage, one of the wheels squeaked each time around, and the clanking and squeaking was Fee&#x2019;s funeral music. Hausenfield&#x2019;s grey pulled harder than his mule and so the wagon turned eastward slowly in an arc. About a mile out in the flats it stopped. Behind the wagon, from the southeast, rain clouds were coming up under the sky.

And for everycritical, defining moment in American history, there were thosewhose impassioned voices rang out, clear and true, and whose wordscompelled the minds and hearts of all who heard them. When PatrickHenry declared, "Give me liberty, or give me death!", when MartinLuther King Jr. said, "I have a dream", Americans listened and wereprofoundly affected. These speeches stand today as testaments tothis great nation made up of individuals with bold ideas andunshakeable convictions.<br> <br> The American Heritage Book of Great American Speeches for YoungPeople includes over 100 speeches by founding fathers, patriots,Native American and African American leaders, abolitionists,women's suffrage and labor activists, writers, athletes, and othersfrom all walks of life, featuring inspiring and unforgettablespeeches by such notable speakers as:<br> <br> Patrick Henry * Thomas Jefferson * Tecumseh * Frederick Douglass *Sojourner Truth * Abraham Lincoln * Susan B. Anthony * Mother Jones* Lou Gehrig * Franklin D. Roosevelt * Albert Einstein * Pearl S.Buck * Langston Hughes * John F. Kennedy * Martin Luther KingJr.<br> <br> These are the voices that shaped our history. They are powerful,moving, and, above all else, uniquely American.</p><p><p><b>SUZANNE MCINTIRE</b> has been collecting great speeches for many years. She is a freelance writer and the mother of two.</p>How many of you remember the agony of having to memorize theGettysburg Address in school? Or perhaps it was something by one ofthe founding father? "Who needs this stuff?" you would moan."What's the point?"<br> The major problem with historic orations, students have alwayscomplained, is that they are dry. American Heritage, one of theforemost magazine about this nation's culture, has collected aneclectic set of speeches given not only by politicians, but also bypeople in many walks of life, from sports figures to "ordinary"people in extraordinary circumstances.<br> The Book of Great American Speeches for Young People contains over100 discourses on a myriad of topics. Some classics can be foundwithin, such as Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream andFranklin Delano Roosevelt's address after the bombing of PearlHarbor on December 7, 1941, "a date which will live in infamy." Ona lighter political note, there's the "Checker's Speech," in whichRichard Nixon swore that the only gift he received during 1952campaign was a little cocker spaniel and that "we're gonna keephim."<br> Other orators in The Book of Great American Speeches for YoungPeople include Malcolm X, Langston Hughes, John F. Kennedy,Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Mark Twain, just to name a few. Speechesare used to influence and encourage, so there are several"declamations" which consider the struggles for women's suffrage,civil right and the evils of slavery. And since the nation wasfounded on free speech, there are also numerous discourses ofprotest and dissent.<br> The less earthshaking fare, though no less dramatic, is also here.Lou Gehrig paid an emotional farewell to baseball, in which, thoughstricken with the terminal illness that would one day bear hisname, he considered himself "the luckiest man on the face of theearth."<br> One of the more poignant speeches, to which young readers willrelate, was given by 10-year old Samantha Smith in 1983 to theChildren's Symposium on the Year 2001, after her impassioned letterto Soviet Premier Yuri Adropov made world news. The letter statedher fears nuclear war between his country and American, provingthat young people can make that difference.<br> In addition to its generous collection, The Book of Great AmericanSpeeches for Young People encourages readers to speak out for whatthey believe in. Its concluding chapter on how (and why) to make aneffective speech will give the reader a boost of confidence and askill which will prove useful long after school days are over.(BookPage, October 2001)<br> <br> Gr7 Up--A useful compendium of more than 100 speeches that spannearly 400 years of American history, from Powhatan (1609) toSenator Charles Robb (2000).

Black-and-white photos andreproductions accompany many of the entries.

It explains how these sweatshops provide the best available opportunity to workers and how they play an important role in the process of development that eventually leads to better wages and working conditions. Using economic theory, the author argues that much of what the anti-sweatshop movement has agitated for would actually harm the very workers they intend to help by creating less desirable alternatives and undermining the process of development. Nowhere does this book put &#34;profits&#34; or &#34;economic efficiency&#34; above people. Improving the welfare of poorer citizens of third world countries is the goal, and the book explores which methods best achieve that goal. Out of Poverty will help readers understand how activists and policy makers can help third world workers.</p><p>This book explores how sweatshops provide the best available opportunity to workers and how they play an important role in the process of development that eventually leads to better wages and working conditions.

Engrossed in building with blocks, the child is a mathematician, scientist, architectm stage designer, and storyteller. And as children build together, they stretch and grow as problem solvers and collaborators. <br><br>The Block Book was the first comprehensive book to explore the values and uses of unit blocks for extending children's growth and development. This book, a classic in early childhood education, has been expanded and updated so that teachers and parents can discover exciting possibilities for the effective use of blocks. <br><br>The time-tested understandings that have made The Block Book a classic are still here, refined and extended with new material that makes the third edition better than ever.</p><p>Elisabeth S. Hirsch, Ph.D., was a teacher of preschoolers in independent private schools and parent cooperatives for many years. She was director of a parent cooperative and a day care center.As illustrated by the chart at the front of this book, block building challenges the whole child. It builds self-confidence; it enhances social skills; it facilitates vocabulary development ; and it stimulates eyehand-body coordination, so important for the development of reading skills. In addition, it enriches the traditional subjects of the curriculum--mathematics, science, and social studies. As they build with blocks, children discover, invent, imagine, and construct a fuller understanding of their world.</p><h2>Maistre: Considerations on France (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)</h2><p>Joseph de Maistre&#39;s Considerations on France (1797) is the best known French equivalent of Burke&#39;s Reflections on the Revolution in France.

With governments playing a supporting role&#x2015;just as they have in the development of modern commercial aeronautics and agricultural production&#x2015;Schmitt believes that a fundamentally private enterprise is the only type of organization capable of sustaining such an effort and, eventually, even making it pay off. </p></p><p><p>Harrison Schmitt is, as of this date, the 12th and last human to have stepped on the Moon. As an astronaut, pilot, geologist, academic, businessman, and United States Senator, he has had a distinguished career in science and technology practice and policy. Schmitt was the first scientist to go into space specifically to explore the Moon as the Lunar Module Pilot and field geologist on the last Lunar Mission, Apollo 17. He is active in private and government sponsored research into a return to the Moon, and in fusion technologies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he is Adjunct Professor of Engineering. In his role as a Senator (R-NM, 1977-1983) he was chairman of the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space.</p><p>From the reviews:</p> <p>There have been many books written about the future lunar exploration and the long-term benefits to the Moon's and Earth's occupants of doing so. Only one book, however, has been written by a man who has actually been to the Moon, explored its surface, and knows firsthand the economic benefits locked in the Moon's regolith. Harrison Scmitt's <em>Return to the Moon </em>will serve as a blueprint for how to achieve this and contribute to making the Vision for Space Exploration a reality.</p> <p>Anthony Young, <em>The Space Review</em>, January 3, 2006</p> <p>"Astronaut geologist Harrison Schmitt outlines his vision of a Return to the Moon, and the mining of helium 3 to provide a future energy source for the earth. ...

(Michael Condry, Spaceflight, Vol. 49, January, 2007)</p> <p>"The author has unique qualifications for writing this exposition. Schmitt was the only scientist among 12 astronauts to visit the Moon ... . There are ... excellent diagrams and pictures from the author&#x2019;s own Apollo 17 mission.

Harris, Space Policy, Vol. 23 (2), 2007)</p> <p>"Former NASA Astronaut Harrison Schmitt ... presents a compelling case for returning man to the moon. ... This bold book is detail oriented and describes how Schmitt would reinvigorate the U.S. space program through a public-private partnership to mine helium-3 on the moon for generating inexpensive fusion power on Earth. Dr. Schmitt, a geologist, astronaut, U.S. Senator, businessman, and teacher, uses his years of experience and knowledge to carefully craft a program to put man back into deep space for the long term."

In years past, corporate social responsibility may have been seen as a feather in a corporation's cap but, today, ecological and social pressures require a new type of business response. In <i>Embedded Sustainability</i>, authors Chris Laszlo and Nadya Zhexembayeva convincingly show how companies can better leverage global challenges for enduring profit and growth. In this outstanding book, readers will learn about the marquis concept of "embedded sustainability": the incorporation of environmental, health, and social value into core business activities with no trade-off in price or quality. When Clorox introduced its new line of Green Works cleaners or Nissan developed its Leaf 100% electric car, these firms were pursuing a profit shift in mainstream markets. In addition to churning out smarter (instead of just greener) products for consumers at large, embedded sustainability is capable of hugely motivating employees. Most of all, it enables companies to create even higher returns for investors, while responding to the new market realities of declining resources, radical transparency, and rising customer expectations. This book helps readers to comprehend&#x2015;and act on&#x2015;the notion of embedded sustainability, explaining why it is now a requisite in every sector, how smart companies are creating even higher value for their customers and investors, and what new management competencies are needed to compete in today's marketplace.</p><p><b>Chris Laszlo</b>, Ph.D., is the author of <i>Sustainable Value: How the World's Leading Companies Are Doing Well by Doing Good</i> (2008) and <i>The Sustainable Company</i> (2003, paperback 2005).

She is a member of the Advisory Board of the Fowler Center for Sustainable Value at the Weatherhead School of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland Ohio. Nadya is also an Associate Partner of Sustainable Value Partners, LLC."Business strategy and competitive advantage are essentially about choice and discipline, though rising ecological and social pressures have left many organizations around the world floundering in terms of what those strategic choices and discipline should look like. Smart leaders will quickly seize on Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's blueprint for embedded sustainability as the foundation for the new economic logic of competitive advantage. Embedded sustainability is the essential discipline for market leaders." (Mason Carpenter, M. Keith Weikel Professor of Leadership <i>University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison</i>)<br><br>"Sustainability thought leader Chris Laszlo and his co-author Zhexembayeva's new book is a magnificent and highly readable tour de force of business strategy and innovation that shows how sustainability is a natural and important progression in thinking about business value. They make a crucial distinction between earlier piecemeal ('bolt-on') approaches to sustainability and the newer generation of strategies that embed sustainability within the core business of the enterprise. The book is a must-read for all serious business executives and managers. It illustrates key points through case studies and examples that provide a clear understanding of how to execute on a strategy of embedded sustainability." (Dr. Ram Nidumolu, Founder and CEO, InnovaStrat <i>Inc.</i>)<br><br>"Chris Laszlo and Nadya Zhexembayeva have not only created a compelling guide for businesses to do well while doing good through Embedded Sustainability. They have also affirmed the critical importance of linking rigorous analytical developments to the testing ground of engagement with real-world problem solving. This book should be required reading in the programs from which future business leaders will emerge." (Rebecca Chopp, President <i>Swarthmore College</i>)<br><br>"We are in the midst of a tectonic shift: The industrial corporate model of the 19th century is dying and being replaced by the sustainable enterprise model of the 21st century. In this new world of declining resources, radical transparency, and increasing expectations, 'corporate social responsibility' will no longer be enough. In this book, Laszlo and Zhexembayeva show clearly that the defining characteristic of the successful 21st century corporation will be its ability to embed sustainability in every fibre of its being. And, even more importantly, embedded sustainability will hold the key to future profit and value creation." (Stuart L. Hart <i>S. C.

In the lottery, what is the chance that two winning balls have consecutive numbers? Who invented Pascal's triangle? (it was not Pascal)<br><br>Combinatorics, the branch of mathematics concerned with selecting, arranging, and listing or counting collections of objects, works to answer all these questions. Dating back some 3000 years, and initially consisting mainly of the study of permutations and combinations, its scope has broadened to include topics such as graph theory, partitions of numbers, block designs, design of codes, and latin squares. In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Robin Wilson gives an overview of the field and its applications in mathematics and computer theory, considering problems from the shortest routes covering certain stops to the minimum number of colours needed to colour a map with different colours for neighbouring countries.<br><strong></strong> ABOUT THE SERIES: The <em> Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

A high infant mortality rate, poor sanitation, risk during childbirth, poisons, ignorance, and war kept 19th-century Americans busy practicing the ritual of mourning. The Victorian era in both Europe and America saw these rituals elevated to an art form expressing not only grief, but also religious feeling, social obligation, and even mourning fashion. Complete with period illustrations, Widow's Weeds and Weeping Veils explores how Victorians viewed death and dying as a result of the profound historical events of their time. This concise, informative work is ideal for students of Victorian-era culture and Civil War enthusiasts.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Introduction<br>Wakes and Funerals<br>The Cemetery<br>The Undertaker<br>Caskets and Coffins<br>The Good Death and the Art of Dying<br>Morbid Desire<br>Post Mortem Photography<br>Spiritualism and the Afterlife<br>An Uncivil Civil War<br>Mourning Art<br>Mourning Jewelry<br>Mourning Clothing<br>Men in Mourning<br>Children in Mourning<br>Stages of Mourning<br>The Etiquette of Mourning<br>The Songs of Sorrow<br>The Vacant Chair and Young Willie Grout<br>Epitaphs<br>Funeral Recipes<br>Gravestone Symbolism<br>The Tear Catcher<br>Mourning Collectibles<br>Victorian Charm Strings<br>End of an Era<br>Endnotes<br>Bibliography</p><p>Bernadette Loeffel-Atkins is a native New Yorker and has lived in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, for over 20 years.

Bauckham argues that there is much more to the Bible&#x2019;s understanding of this relationship than the mandate of human dominion given in Genesis 1&#x2015;which, he writes, has too often been used as a justification for domination and exploitation of the earth&#x2019;s resources. Instead, Bauckham considers the ecological perspectives found in the book of Job, the Psalms, and the Gospels, all of which, he determines, require a reevaluation of the biblical tradition of "dominion." Bauckham discovers a tradition of a "community of creation" in which human beings are fellow members with God&#x2019;s other creatures and true reconciliation to God involves the entire creation. Short, reliable, and engaging, <i>The Bible and Ecology</i> is essential reading for anyone looking for a biblically grounded approach to ecology.</p></p><p><br>A concise, engaging introduction to the Bible's ecological vision<br><p>Richard Bauckham was, until 2007, Professor of New Testament Studies and Bishop Wardlaw Professor in the University of St Andrews, Scotland, and is now Professor Emeritus at St Andrews.

But Harvey has broken with her and renounced the idea of spiritual gurus. In this book, he discusses manifestations of the Divine Mother or feminine principle in Hindu, Sufi, Buddhist, and Christian teachings. He believes the next 20 years will determine the fate of life on earth and that "a new spiritual age is potentially dawning for humankind...in which the divine could be present intimately, normally, consciously, in all things and activities...through the grace of the Mother."

In &#34;Creative Followership: In the Shadow of Greatness,&#34; Collins uses personal illustrations and stories to tell how he discovered and used his &#34;Creative Followership Principles&#34; for a successful and satisfying thirty-two-year career of service. Collins hopes to offer an inspiring message for men and women entering or redirecting their careers. He says, &#34;My mission is to use my life experience to motivate others to venture out on a journey of discovery and adventure.&#34; Starting at the age of twelve, he delivered groceries on a bicycle for a neighborhood store. By the time he retired, he was the chief operating officer of a one-billion-dollar restaurant chain. A real success story! &#34;Creative Followership&#34; promises readers a better route to success and satisfaction than the over-emphasized pursuit of leadership roles. Collins begins &#34;Creative Followership&#34; with his unrealized search for a formula to become a leader. He reminds readers why leadership cannot be taught. He points out that only those who have followers are leaders, and that followers choose to follow a leader because of a unifying purpose that they can share. For example, Collins describes his absolute loyalty to Truett Cathy, founder of Chick-fil-A, which he claims resulted in Truett&#39;s unwavering support of him as Truett&#39;s &#34;Chief Follower.&#34; He also explains how he built his career using these Creative Followership Principles, which are easily transferable and usable for any individual in any organization. Jimmy&#39;s own journey to becoming a business executive and receiving the recognition and reward that followed is living proof of the effectiveness of these principles.</p><p>Born in an unpainted share-cropper house in the middle of cotton fields, <b>Jimmy Collins</b> dreamed of becoming an executive. His story of the pathway he discovered for the realization of that dream is told in his book, In the Shadow of Greatness. He named that pathway Creative Followership. Jimmy is certain that anyone can use his Creative Followership Principles for their own journey to success and satisfaction. From his first job of delivering groceries on a bicycle at 12 years old, to establishing his own business as a commercial kitchen design consultant, to his 32 year career with Chick-fil-A, Inc., he learned and applied the principles that you also can learn. Jimmy retired from Chick-fil-A, Inc. as president, Chief Operating Officer. He describes his role there as the chief follower of the founder, S. Truett Cathy. In year 2000, Jimmy received the prestigious Silver Plate Award as Chain Fast Service Operator of the Year. Michael Cooley enjoys the challenge of creative communication using words and images.

This book provides the nutritional component of that muscle-building equation, offering the <i>Men's Health</i> take on food for fitness. <i>Men's Health Muscle Chow</i> gives you more than 150 simple recipes for delicious meals ranging from workout protein shakes to healthy dinners the whole family will enjoy. <br><br>Inside, you'll find: <br><br>-Eight easy-to-remember dietary strategies to keep your eating habits in line <br>-Filling breakfasts like Banana Protein Pancakes; energizing entre&#x301;es including Muscle-Bound Chili and Mahi Fish Wraps; hunger-killing snacks such as Malted Almond Bombs; even desserts like Key Lime Pie-all designed to help burn fat and build muscle <br>-A shopping list that makes it easy to stock up on essential ingredients and kitchen tools <br>-A troubleshooting guide for guys with more experience at the gym than in the kitchen <br>-Insider strategies, tips, tricks of the trade<br><br>And <i>Men's Health Muscle Chow</i> is much more than just a cookbook.

Avedon lives in Weston, Florida.You don't have to be a gym rat to appreciate what certified personal trainer and Men's Health cover model Avedon has to say in this sensible, easily customizable approach to nutrition and fitness. Unsurprisingly, Avedon's technique boils down to eating a series of small meals throughout the day, emphasizing lean meats, whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables. Some recipes, most notably protein shakes, call for protein powder and/or other nutrients requiring a special trip to the health food store, but most other ingredients are easily sourced. The most jarring adjustment for those following Avedon's program will likely be the absence of salt and refined white sugar in virtually all of his 150-plus recipes: sweet dishes like Raspberry Mocha Chocolate Chip Cookies and Peach Cobbler use stevia or a similar sugar substitute. Once readers get past that hurdle they'll find plenty of easy-to-prepare recipes that taste as good as they sound. Avedon has thoughtfully weighted the book in favor of familiar classics like deviled eggs, chili, meatloaf, lasagna and key lime pie, as well as familiar health-food staples like baked squash and steamed fish. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A singer's career changes direction when she walks into the wrong audition. A husband gives his wife an unexpected gift&#x2014;after she repeatedly dreams about that very same item.... It was Carl Jung who coined the term "synchronicity" for those&nbsp;strange coincidences, when events seem to conspire to tell us something, to teach us, to turn our lives around. They are the strange "plot developments" that make us feel like characters in a grand, mysterious story. How do we identify these coincidences as something special? How do we recognize their significance and use them as turning points toward a more meaningful life story? In <i>There Are No Accidents</i>, Jungian psychotherapist Robert Hopcke explores the nature of the human conciousness and the&nbsp;role of synchronicity&#x2014;teaching us to examine our own stories, and tap into its power to strengthen our work, love, and spiritual lives.</p><p>Think back on all the coincidences that have shaped your life--the homes you lived in, the love stories you created, the jobs you held.

A month has passed since Stalingrad. Though Hitler insists Germany is winning the war, morale is low and commanders on the ground know better. Then Berlin learns of a Red massacre of Polish troops near Smolensk, Russia. In a rare instance of agreement, both the Wehrmacht and Propaganda Minister Goebbels want irrefutable evidence of this Russian atrocity. And so Bernie Gunther is dispatched. <br><br>In Smolensk, Bernie finds an enclave of Prussian aristocrats who look down at the wise-cracking, rough-edged Berlin bull. But Bernie doesn&#x2019;t care about fitting in. He only wants to uncover the identity of a savage killer&#x2014;before becoming a victim himself.</p><p><b>Philip Kerr</b>&nbsp;was the<i> New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the acclaimed Bernie Gunther novels, three of which&#x2014;<i>Field Gray</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Lady from Zagreb</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Prussian Blue</i>&#x2014;were finalists for the Edgar Award for Best Novel. Kerr also won several Shamus Awards and the British Crime Writers&#x2019; Association Ellis Peters Award for Historical Crime Fiction. Just before his death in 2018, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. As P.B. Kerr, he was the author of the much-loved young adult fantasy series Children of the Lamp.<p>1</p><p>Franz Meyer stood up at the head of the table, glanced down, touched the cloth, and awaited our silence. With his fair hair, blue eyes, and neoclassical features that looked as if they&#x2019;d been carved by Arno Breker, Hitler&#x2019;s official state sculptor, he was no one&#x2019;s idea of a Jew. Half of the SS and SD were more obviously Semitic. Meyer took a deep, almost euphoric breath, gave a broad grin that was part relief and part joie de vivre, and raised his glass to each of the four women seated around the table. None were Jewish and yet, by the racial stereotypes beloved of the Propaganda Ministry, they might have been; all were Germans with strong noses, dark eyes, and even darker hair. For a moment Meyer seemed choked with emotion, and when at last he was able to speak, there were tears in his eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to thank my wife and her sisters for your efforts on my behalf,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;To do what you did took great courage, and I can&#x2019;t tell you what it meant to those of us who were imprisoned in the Jewish Welfare Office to know that there were so many people on the outside who cared enough to come and demonstrate on our behalf.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I still can&#x2019;t believe they haven&#x2019;t arrested us,&#x201d; said Meyer&#x2019;s wife, Siv.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re so used to people just doing what they&#x2019;re told,&#x201d; said his sister-in-law, Klara, &#x201c;that they don&#x2019;t know what to do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go back to Rosenstrasse tomorrow,&#x201d; insisted Siv. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t stop until everyone in there is released. All two thousand of them. We&#x2019;ve shown what we can do when public opinion is mobilized. We have to keep the pressure up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Meyer. &#x201c;And we will. We will. But right now I&#x2019;d like to propose a toast. To our new friend Bernie Gunther. But for him and his colleagues at the War Crimes Bureau, I&#x2019;d probably still be imprisoned in the Jewish Welfare Office. And who knows where after that?&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;To Bernie.&#x201d;</p><p>There were six of us in the cozy little dining room in the Meyers&#x2019; apartment in L�tzowerstrasse. As four of them stood up and toasted me silently, I shook my head. I wasn&#x2019;t sure I deserved Franz Meyer&#x2019;s thanks, and besides, the wine we were drinking was a decent German red&#x2014;a Sp�tburgunder from long before the war that he and his wife would have done better to have traded for some food instead of wasting it on me. Any wine&#x2014;let alone a good German red&#x2014;was almost impossible to come by in Berlin.</p><p>Politely I waited for them to drink to my health before standing up to contradict my host. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I can claim to have had much influence on the SS,&#x201d; I explained. &#x201c;I spoke to a couple of cops I know who were policing your demonstration and they told me there&#x2019;s a strong rumor doing the rounds that most of the prisoners arrested on Saturday as part of the factory action will probably be released in a few days.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s incredible,&#x201d; said Klara. &#x201c;But what does it mean, Bernie? Do you think the authorities are actually going soft on deportations?&#x201d;</p><p>Before I could offer my opinion the air raid warning siren sounded. We all looked at each other in surprise; it had been almost two years since the last air raid by the Royal Air Force.</p><p>&#x201c;We should go to the shelter,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Or the basement, perhaps.&#x201d;</p><p>Meyer nodded. &#x201c;Yes, you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; he said firmly. &#x201c;You should all go. Just in case it&#x2019;s for real.&#x201d;</p><p>I fetched my coat and hat off the stand and turned back to Meyer.</p><p>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re coming, too, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Jews aren&#x2019;t permitted in the shelters. Perhaps you didn&#x2019;t notice it before. Well, there&#x2019;s no reason why you should have. I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s been an air raid since we started to wear the yellow star.&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head. &#x201c;No, I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; I shrugged. &#x201c;So, where are Jews supposed to go?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To hell, of course. At least that&#x2019;s what they hope.&#x201d; This time Meyer&#x2019;s grin was sardonic. &#x201c;Besides, people know this is a Jewish apartment, and since the law requires that homes be left with their doors and windows open, to minimize the effect of a pressure wave from a bomb blast, that&#x2019;s also an invitation to some local thief to come and steal from us.&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;So I shall stay here.&#x201d;</p><p>I glanced out the window; in the street below, hundreds of people were already being herded toward the local shelter by uniformed police. There wasn&#x2019;t much time to lose.</p><p>&#x201c;Franz,&#x201d; said Siv. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not going there without you. Just leave your coat. If they can&#x2019;t see your star, they&#x2019;ll have to assume you&#x2019;re German. You can carry me in and say I fainted, and if I show my pass and say I&#x2019;m your wife then no one will be any the wiser.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;And if I&#x2019;m arrested, what then? I&#x2019;ve only just been released.&#x201d; Meyer shook his head and laughed. &#x201c;Besides, it&#x2019;s probably a false alarm. Hasn&#x2019;t Fat Hermann promised us that this is the best-defended city in Europe?&#x201d;</p><p>The siren continued to wail outside like some dreadful mechanical clarion announcing the end of a night shift in the smoking factories of hell.</p><p>Siv Meyer sat down at the table and clasped her hands tight. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re not going, then I&#x2019;m not going.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Neither am I,&#x201d; Klara said, sitting down beside her.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no time to argue about this,&#x201d; said Meyer. &#x201c;You should go. All of you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; I said, more urgently now as already we could hear the drone of the bombers in the distance; it was obvious this was no false alarm. I opened the door and waved the four women toward me. &#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Siv. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re staying.&#x201d;</p><p>The two other sisters glanced at each other and then sat down alongside their Jewish brother-in-law. This left me on my feet with a coat in my hand and a nervous look on my face. After all, I&#x2019;d seen what our own bombers had done to Minsk and parts of France. I put on the coat and shoved my hands in the pockets so as to conceal the fact that they were shaking.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;re coming to drop propaganda leaflets,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Not this time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but it&#x2019;s not civilians like us they&#x2019;re after, surely,&#x201d; said Siv. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the government district. They&#x2019;ll know there&#x2019;s a hospital near here. The RAF won&#x2019;t want to risk hitting the Catholic Hospital, will they? The English aren&#x2019;t like that. It&#x2019;s the Wilhelmstrasse they&#x2019;ll be after.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How will they know from two thousand feet up in the air?&#x201d; I heard myself utter weakly.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; said Meyer. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the west of Berlin they&#x2019;re targeting. It&#x2019;s the east. Which means it&#x2019;s probably just as well we&#x2019;re none of us in Rosenstrasse tonight.&#x201d; He smiled at me. &#x201c;You should go, Bernie. We&#x2019;ll be all right. You&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I expect you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; I said and, deciding to ignore the air raid siren like the others, I started to take off my coat. &#x201c;All the same, I can hardly leave you all here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; asked Klara.</p><p>I shrugged, but what it really came down to was this: I could hardly leave and still manage to look good in Klara&#x2019;s lovely brown eyes, and I was quite keen that she should have a good impression of me; but I didn&#x2019;t feel I could say this to her, not yet.</p><p>For a moment I felt my chest tighten as my nerves continued to get the better of me. Then I heard some bombs explode in the distance and breathed a sigh of relief. Back in the trenches, during the Great War, when you could hear the shells exploding somewhere else, it usually meant you were safe because it was commonly held that you never heard the one that killed you.</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds like it&#x2019;s north Berlin that&#x2019;s getting it,&#x201d; I said, leaning in the doorway. &#x201c;The petroleum refinery on Thalerstrasse, probably. It&#x2019;s the only real target around here. But I think we should at least get under the table. Just in case a stray bomb&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>I think that was the last thing I said and probably it was the fact that I was standing in the doorway that saved my life because just then the glass in the nearest window frame seemed to melt into a thousand drops of light. Some of these old Berlin apartment buildings were made to last, and I later learned that the bomb that blew up the one we were in&#x2014;not to mention the hospital on L�tzowstrasse&#x2014;and flattened it in a split second would certainly have killed me had not the lintel above my head and the stout oak door that was hanging inside it resisted the weight of the roof&#x2019;s metal joist, for this is what killed Siv Meyer and her three sisters.</p><p>After that there was darkness and silence, except for the sound of a kettle on a gas plate whistling as it came slowly to the boil, although this was probably just the sensation in my battered eardrums. It was as if someone had switched off an electric light and then pulled away the floorboards on which I had been standing, and the effect of the world disappearing from underneath my feet might have been similar to the sensation of being hooded and hanged on a gallows. I don&#x2019;t know. All I really remember of what happened is that I was upside down lying on a pile of rubble when I recovered consciousness and there was a door on top of my face which, for several minutes until I recovered enough breath in my bomb-blasted lungs to moan for help, I was convinced was the lid of my own damned coffin.</p></p><h2>The Ticket That Exploded: The Restored Text</h2><p>As this new edition reveals, the cultural reach of <i>The Ticket That Exploded</i> has expanded with the viral logic of Burroughs&#x2019;s multimedia methods, recycling itself into our digital environment.

His ideas spread like wildfire across Europe, offering the scientific view that the natural world, including the soul of man, was a proper subject of study. The rediscovery of these ancient ideas sparked riots and heresy trials, caused major upheavals in the Catholic Church, and also set the stage for today's rift between reason and religion. <br><br>In Aristotle's Children, Richard Rubenstein transports us back in history, rendering the controversies of the Middle Ages lively and accessible-and allowing us to understand the philosophical ideas that are fundamental to modern thought.<br></p><p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2003, 0-15-100720-9<br>"A superb storyteller who breathes new life into such fascinating figures as Peter Abelard, Albertus Magnus, St. Thomas Aquinas, Roger Bacon, William of Ockham and Aristotle himself." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>The intellectual explosion that transformed Europe in the Middle Ages and coursed through the Western world, triggered student riots and heresy trials, and set the stage for today's rift between reason and religion. The ideas came from Aristotle. His work, like the rest of Greek culture, had been lost in the centuries after the fall of Rome, when the Greek language was forgotten. But in the Muslim world, the wisdom of the Greeks was never lost and contributed to the flowering of Islamic culture.<br><br>When scholars in the twelfth century collaborated on translating the ancient classics, they resurrected ideas that turned Western thinking away from the supernatural world and toward the world of nature. With their optimistic view of human nature, these ideas sparked fierce controversies in the universities and caused major changes in the Catholic Church. Rubenstein shows how the Church adopted these new ideas and struggled to reconcile science and religion and how Western thinking was set on the path it has followed ever since.<br><br>This is a feast for readers who are fascinated by medieval history, and a treat for all who want to understand the ideas that are fundamental to modern thought.<br><br>Richard E.

After a decade fighting wars on two fronts, tens of thousands of service members are coming home having trouble adjusting to civilian life; this includes struggling as parents. Why Is Dad So Mad? Is a narrative story told from a family&#39;s point of view (mother and children) of a service member who struggles with PTSD and its symptoms. Many service members deal with anger, forgetfulness, sleepless nights, and nightmares.This book explains these and how they affect Dad. The moral of the story is that even though Dad gets angry and yells, he still loves his family more than anything.</p><p>Seth Kastle is the Author of the children&#x2019;s book Why is Dad So Mad? and the upcoming Why is Mom So Mad?. Both of these books were written in order to assist military families who are struggling with PTSD. Seth retired after a 16 year military career as a Company First Sergeant. He was deployed in January 2002 to Qatar, and then to Afghanistan for a total of eight months. He was then deployed to Iraq in January 2003 until April 2004. He has been married for nearly ten years now to his wife Julia, and has two daughters; Raegan and Kennedy. He wrote the book Why is Dad So Mad? to try to help his children understand why he is the way he is now. The overriding purpose of these books is to let children of services members know that no matter what, their parents love them more than anything, despite the challenges that are faced.

From Kirkegaard's thoughts on coping with death to the I Ching's guidelines on adapting to change, <em>Plato, Not Prozac!</em> makes philosophy accessible and shows you how to use it to solve your everyday problems.</p><p>Gone is the need for expensive therapists, medication, and lengthy analysis. Clearly organized by common problems to help you tailor Dr. Lou Marinoff's advice to your own needs, this is an intelligent, effective, and persuasive prescription for self-healing therapy that is giving psychotherapy a run for its money.</p></p><p><p>Lou Marinoff, Ph.D., is a philosophy professor at the City College of New York, a pioneer of the philosophical practice movement in North America, and president of the American Philosophical Practitioners Association (AAPA).

It is to solve some of the problems of life, not theoretically, but practically."<br>--Henry David Thoreau<p><br><br>A young woman confronts her mother's terminal breast cancer. A man contemplates a midlife career change. A Protestant woman whose daughter is engaged to a Jewish man and whose son is married to a Muslim woman fears potential religious conflicts. A successful business executive struggles over whether to leave his wife of over twenty years. A woman is happily living with her partner, but only one of them wants children. An engineer and single father supporting four children is afraid that blowing the whistle on a design flaw in a high-pressure project could cost him his job. A woman who has everything she thought she wanted--loving husband and children, beautiful house, high-paying career--struggles with meaninglessness: when she looks at her life she thinks, "Is this all there is?" <br>All of these people have sought professional help in managing the problems they feel overwhelming them. In another day, they might have found their way to the offices of a psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, marriage counselor, or even their general practitioner for help with "mental illness." Or they might have consulted a spiritual adviser or turned to religion for moral instruction and guidance. And some of them may have been helped in those places. They may also have endured discussions about their childhoods, analysis of their behavior patterns, prescriptions for antidepressants, or arguments about their sinful nature or God's forgiveness, none of which got to the heart of their struggle. And they may well have been signed up for a lengthy and open-ended course of treatment, with a focus on diagnosing the illness as though it were a tumor to be excised or a symptom to be controlled with drugs.<br>But now there's another option for people unsatisfied by or opposed to psychological or psychiatric therapy: philosophical counseling. What the people described above did was seek out a different kind of assistance. They consulted a philosophical practitioner, looking for insight from the world's great wisdom traditions. As established religious institutions lose their authority with more and more people, and as psychology and psychiatry exceed the limits of their usefulness in people's lives (and begin to do more harm than good), many people are coming to the realization that philosophical expertise encompasses logic, ethics, values, meaning, rationality, decision-making in situations of conflict or risk, and all the vast complexities that characterize human life.<br>People facing these situations need to talk in terms deep and broad enough to address their concerns. By getting a handle on their personal philosophies of life, sometimes with the help of the great thinkers of the past, they can build a framework for managing whatever they face and go into the next situation more solidly grounded and spiritually or philosophically whole. They need dialogue, not diagnosis.<br>You can apply this process in your own life. You can work on your own, though sometimes it helps to have a partner to converse with who can make sure you're not overlooking something or settling for rationalization over rationality. With the guidance and examples in this book, you'll be ready to discover the benefits of an examined life, including peace of mind, stability, and integrity. You don't need any experience in philosophy, and you don't have to read Plato's Republic or any other philosophy text (unless you want to). All you need is a philosophical turn of mind, which, since you've picked up this book and read this far, I'd say you have.<br></p><br>A Philosophy of One's Own<br>Everyone has a philosophy of life, but few of us have the privilege or leisure to sit around and puzzle out the fine points. We tend to make it up as we go along. Experience is a great teacher, but we also need to reason about our experiences. We need to think critically, looking for patterns and putting everything together into the big picture to make our way through life. Understanding our own philosophy can help prevent, resolve, or manage many problems. Our philosophies can also underlie the problems we experience, so we must evaluate the ideas we hold to craft an outlook that works for us, not against us. You can change what you believe in order to work out a problem, and this book will show you how.<br>Despite its current reputation, philosophy doesn't have to be intimidating, boring, or incomprehensible. Much of what's been written on the subject over the years certainly falls into one or more of those categories, but at its heart, philosophy examines the questions we all ask: What is a good life? What is good? What is life about? Why am I here? Why should I do the right thing? What is the right thing? These are not easy questions, and there are no easy answers or we wouldn't still be mulling them over. No two people will automatically arrive at the same answers. But we all have a set of operating principles we work from, whether or not we are conscious of them and can enumerate them.<br>The great thing about having thousands of years of thinking to draw on is that many of history's wisest minds have weighed in on these subjects and have left insights and guidelines for us to use.

By 1979 it had a powerful industrial economy and a vibrant civil society in the making, which would lead to a democratic breakthrough eight years later. The transformation took place during the years of Park Chung Hee's presidency. Park seized power in a coup in 1961 and ruled as a virtual dictator until his assassination in October 1979. He is credited with modernizing South Korea, but at a huge political and social cost.</p><p>South Korea's political landscape under Park defies easy categorization. The state was predatory yet technocratic, reform-minded yet quick to crack down on dissidents in the name of political order. The nation was balanced uneasily between opposition forces calling for democratic reforms and the Park government's obsession with economic growth. The chaebol (a powerful conglomerate of multinationals based in South Korea) received massive government support to pioneer new growth industries, even as a nationwide campaign of economic shock therapy-interest hikes, devaluation, and wage cuts-met strong public resistance and caused considerable hardship.</p><p>This landmark volume examines South Korea's era of development as a study in the complex politics of modernization. Drawing on an extraordinary range of sources in both English and Korean, these essays recover and contextualize many of the ambiguities in South Korea's trajectory from poverty to a sustainable high rate of economic growth.</p></p><p><p>Byung-Kook Kim is Professor of Political Science and International Relations at Korea University.</p><p>Ezra F.

Some are outright fabrications; others contain a kernel of truth that has been embellished over the years. Collaborating with The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, Mary Miley Theobald has uncovered the truth behind many widely repeated myth-understandings in our history in <i>Death by Petticoat</i> including:<br><br>* Hat makers really were driven mad. They were poisoned by the mercury used in making hats from furs. Their symptoms included hallucinations, tremors, and twitching, which looked like insanity to people of the 17th and 18th centuries--and the phrase "mad as a hatter" came about.<br><br>* The idea that portrait painters gave discounts if their subjects posed with one hand inside the vest (so they didn't have to paint fingers and leading to the saying that something "costs an arm and a leg") is strictly myth. It isn't likely that Napoleon, King George III, or George Washington were concerned about getting a discount from their portrait painters.<br><br>Pregnant women secluded themselves indoors, uneven stairs were made to trip up burglars, people bathed once a year, women had tiny waists, apprenticeships lasted seven years--<i>Death by Petticoat</i> reveals the truth about these hysterical historical myth-understandings.</p><p>Mary Miley Theobald has taught history, works at a historical foundation, writes and blogs about historical myths, and pens historical fiction books.

(<i>Choice</i>)</p><h2>The Testament of Solomon</h2><p><p>This edition of the Testament of Solomon is a complete and accurate reprint of the original translation of ancient manuscripts by F.C. Conybeare first printed in 1898. It contains all Conybeare&#x2019;s original notes and commentary, including the Greek characters he footnoted for the reader&#x2019;s consideration. Beware of other editions of this work that do not contain all the original text.</p><p>The Testament of Solomon is a pseudepigraphical work attributed to King Solomon the Wise of the Old Testament. Written in the first-person narrative, the book tells the story of the creation of the magical ring of King Solomon and how Solomon&#x2019;s ring was used to bind and control demons, including Beelzebub. In this book of King Solomon, the discourses between the King and the various spirits are told, and the story shows how Solomon uses his wisdom to withstand the demons&#x2019; tricks and guile and enlist their aid in the building of his temple. The spells and seals of Solomon used by the King to bind the spirits are detailed, which makes this work a book of Solomon&#x2019;s magic, similar in nature to the Lesser Key of Solomon the King and the Greater Key of Solomon the King, which both are King Solomon books of magic and contain various talismans of Solomon, including the secret seal of Solomon.</p><p>The manuscripts from which this work was discovered date from the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. All were written in Greek. This dating makes most experts believe that the work is medieval. But some scholars, including D.C. Duling, argue that it is likely that the work comes from the 5th or 6th centuries. The various manuscripts used to source the work all date to medieval times, but the text itself, as well as references to other works, indicate the Testament is much older.</p><p>For example, in the Dialogue of Timothy and Aquila, there is a direct reference to the Testament of Solomon. The Dialogue purports to have been written during the Archbishopric of Cyril in 444 C.E., and therefore, its reference would date the Testament before that time. Similarly, in the early 4th century Gnostic text On the Origin of the World, references to the book of Solomon and his 49 demons are made.</p><p>No matter the date, the text provides an immensely interesting description of how King Solomon tamed various demons to build his temple. The text includes predictions of the coming of Christ, as one demon explains to Solomon that while he may be bound, the only thing that can truly take his power away is the man born from a virgin who will be crucified by the Jews.</p></p><p><p>Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare was born in Coulsdon, Surrey, England, on September 14, 1856. His father, John Charles Conybeare was a barrister in his home town. Conybeare attended university at Oxford where he studied the humanities, graduating with a BA, and then a MA in 1882. While in school he showed great aptitude for scholarship in his chosen field of study and was named praelector in both philosophy and ancient history.</p> <p>After school, Conybeare began the study of the Armenian and Georgian languages with the aim of publishing translations of various texts from those languages. The texts that occupied Conybeare&#x2019;s efforts were mostly Christian in nature and subject, and, after some time, the works began asserting an influence on the scholar and he became interested in church history. His travels and translations of manuscripts from throughout Europe led to some important discoveries, including numerous works from Georgian and Armenian texts that bore directly on the early history of the Christian Church. He died on January 9, 1924 and was buried in Brompton Cemetery alongside his father and grandfather. At the time of his death, he had a fortune in ancient Armenian and Georgian texts, which were donated to the London Library.</p></p><h2>The Singer&#39;s Musical Theatre Anthology: Mezzo-Soprano/Belter, Vol. 4</h2><p>(Vocal Collection).

Contributors explore how different forms of ignorance linked to race are produced and sustained and what role they play in promoting racism and white privilege. They argue that the ignorance that underpins racism is not a simple gap in knowledge, the accidental result of an epistemological oversight. In the case of racial oppression, ignorance often is actively produced for purposes of domination and exploitation. But as these essays demonstrate, ignorance is not simply a tool of oppression wielded by the powerful. It can also be a strategy for survival, an important tool for people of color to wield against white privilege and white supremacy. The book concludes that understanding ignorance and the politics of such ignorance should be a key element of epistemological and social/political analyses, for it has the potential to reveal the role of power in the construction of what is known and provide a lens for the political values at work in knowledge practices.</p><p>Offering a wide variety of philosophical approaches to the neglected philosophical problem of ignorance, this groundbreaking collection builds on Charles Mills's claim that racism involves an inverted epistemology, an epistemology of ignorance.

A leading British evangelical New Testament scholar answers that question with studies on themes from messianism to monotheism, symbolic actions from foot washing to fish catching, literary contexts from Qumran to the Hellenistic historians, and figures from Nicodemus to &#34;the beloved disciple&#34; to Papias. Originally published in various journals and collections, these essays are now available for the first time in one affordable volume with a substantial new introduction that ties them all together. A must have for serious students of the Fourth Gospel.</p><p>"<i>The Testimony of the Beloved Disciple</i> is more than a collection of Richard Bauckham's essays on the Fourth Gospel. Taken as a whole, it is a programmatic statement of the author's thesis and argument, the crux of which is embodied in the title. If one infers that Bauckham believes the Johannine community of scholarship has largely gone off the rails, that would not be wrong. He proposes to set it right by paying close attention to the Gospel's own data and claims and by canvassing and assessing the considerable body of evidence bearing on this Gospel in patristic sources. This has not been done in a long time, and perhaps never as thoroughly and with such penetrating critical insight. That Bauckham has a thesis to set out and defend makes his book all the more interesting and important."<br>--<b>D. Moody Smith</b>, The Divinity School, Duke University<br><br>"This collection of twelve essays on historical and theological Johannine problems is preluded by a comprehensive introduction containing a scholarly program for Johannine research in the future. These studies will give us quite new stimuli for our understanding of the Gospel of John, for Bauckham illuminates neglected historical and theological features of this unique text. The author demonstrates that in our exegesis of John philological accuracy, profound historical knowledge, and genuine theological understanding must work together to gain new insights."<br>--<b>Martin Hengel</b>, University of T�bingen<br><br>"As always, Bauckham is brilliant, providing a fresh rethinking of issues based on his breadth of knowledge of early Judaism and Christianity. While well conversant with current scholarly discussions, he marshals new data and new ideas in ways that invite new perspectives. This work offers insights on various Johannine topics and merits center stage in any new discussions of history in John's Gospel."<br>--<b>Craig Keener</b>, Asbury Theological Seminary<br><br>"This substantive collection of essays focuses and reenergizes the debate over the historical reliability of the Gospel of John.

Terrorists crashed two passenger airliners into the World Trade Center in the worst attack on U.S. soil in the nation's history. But at the same time a new generation of heroes rose up to fight it. This book chronicles not only the devastation of that day, but also the valor and heroism of those who saved thousands of lives.<p>Not one of these photographs has been published before. On top of that, these images offer a vantage point no ordinary photographers could obtain: They were taken by members of the New York City Police Department, uniformed and civilian, who were on the scene moments after the first plane hit and who were behind the scenes during the entire rescue and recovery effort.</p><p>Many officers took pictures during the course of their duties. Some were inside the lobbies of the World Trade Center before they collapsed. Some were in helicopters hovering near the burning towers. Some were trapped in the dust cloud after the buildings fell. They took pictures of the pandemonium around them, the fear, the effort, the exasperation. This collection portrays the courage of those who rushed into the danger so that others could escape it.</p><p>One of the featured photographers, Detective Dave Fitzpatrick, was off duty when he heard a report of the attack over his radio. He immediately went to an NYPD airfield, joined a crew boarding a police helicopter, and flew to the World Trade Center. They arrived right after the second plane hit and were instructed to observe the scene and watch for any other incoming aircraft. Over the course of three flights that day, Fitzpatrick shot thousands of photographs that became the only aerial views of the devastation and early rescue efforts downtown. He also covered all Ground Zero operations for the next two months. His best photos, along with those of numerous other members of the NYPD, have been collected in this book. Together they make up the most in-depth visual document of the September 11th tragedy and its aftermath.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p>Established in 1845, the <b>New York City Police Department </b>(NYPD) is the largest municipal police force in the United States and is one of the most recognizable law enforcement agencies in the world.Adult/High School-One of the better photographic remembrances of the World Trade Center disaster. None of these color photos have heretofore been published and many depict scenes or were taken from positions that were off-limits to commercial or amateur photographers. Particularly breathtaking are those taken by Dave Fitzpatrick, an off-duty detective who rushed to board a police helicopter that morning and spent the remainder of the day taking thousands of photographs "that became the only aerial views of the devastation and early rescue efforts." The photos are chronologically arranged, beginning minutes after the first plane hit the North Tower, continuing through the succeeding days of search-and-rescue operations, and culminating with the cleanup. Many are full page and there are at least a dozen spreads. As a "photographic record," this coffee-table-sized book documents a historic event, confirming, for example, why no rooftop rescues were possible and the extent of the damage to the entire area now known as Ground Zero. It also stands as a tribute to the public-safety employees, construction workers, and volunteers who worked side by side throughout a horrific ordeal. The book is dedicated to the 23 members of the NYPD who were lost that day and to their families.<br><i>Dori DeSpain, Fairfax County Public Library, VA</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Spirited Away, Vol. 5 (Spirited Away Film Comics)</h2><p>Is Haku&#39;s illness really from a curse laid on him by Yubaba&#39;s sister Zeniba?

A contemporary of Jackson Pollock and Willem De Kooning, she is not as well known as her male counterparts because she was a woman and also because she spent most of her working life in France. Still, in 2013, <em>Bloomsburg Business</em> listed Mitchell as the bestselling female artist of all time. When asked to talk about her paintings, Joan Mitchell often responded, &#x201c;If I could say it in words, I&#x2019;d write a book.&#x201d; Here is her book. At once unique and universal, <em>Blue Territory</em> is at its core an exploration of love and life, and what it means to love - and live - what you do. Meticulously researched and lyrically written, it will appeal to anyone interested in passionate engagement with the world. The book eschews images so as to allow the words to form them, thereby freeing the reader to imagine the paintings, much as Mitchell would have to do before picking up her brush.</p></p><p><p><b>Robin Lippincott</b> has published three novels--<i>In the Meantime</i>, <i>Our Arcadia</i>, and <i>Mr. Dalloway</i>, as well as a collection of short stories, <i>The 'I' Rejected</i>.

He has erased the boundaries between Mitchell&#39;s art and her life, capturing the quality of light, the saturation of color in her work as deftly as her originality, loneliness, and intensity. Blue Territory will open your eyes to the work of one remarkable artist, and to what art at its best can do.&#34; - Eleanor Morse, Author, White Dog Fell from the Sky &#34;The title speaks to it...blue is her color. Blue is Joan Mitchell. This book evokes her spirit through a serious of carefully chosen quotes and poignant ruminations. [It is] a biography that is elegantly written and more than a meditation. It&#39;s glorious.&#34; - Alex Nyerges, Director, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts &#34;In Blue Territory, Robin Lippincott assembles and unfolds the facts, events, and relationships of Joan Mitchell&#39;s life, poetically constructing a portrait of this important painter. Joan loved her life as an artist - it was one full of risks, high and low points, of art to make and see, and artists, poets, writers and composers to meet. She was an intellectual, a fighter, a person of integrity; full of empathy, love, and anguish. Through all of her travails, she painted - from late at night until early in the morning. With this beautiful book, which is at once specific and insightful, oblique and haunting, Lippincott conveys a sense of who Joan Mitchell was, and the substance of her work.&#34; - Sally Apfelbaum, Artist, friend of Joan Mitchell &#34;Robin Lippincott has an uncanny ability to convey just what he finds so compelling about Joan Mitchell-from her gutsy struggle to thrive in the male-dominated art world of the &#39;50s and &#39;60s, to her last valiant efforts to work while dying of lung cancer. Combining personal essay, biography, and a dash of fiction, Blue Territory freely imagines the artist&#39;s interiority and boldly celebrates her life, hitting on deeper truths regarding artistic endeavor, the art of living, and the equally creative act of fandom.&#34; - Clifford Chase, Author, The Tooth Fairy and Winkie &#34;No mere recounting of the life of an artistic figure, Blue Territory is an audacious rendering of an artist, her passion, her obstacles, and her triumphant work. Robin Lippincott has created a genre of his own in this revelation of Joan Mitchell and her world. Here, the abstract nature of her painting is made concrete, the metaphysics of her vision made tangible, and her vibrant color finds its perfect translation in equally vivid prose. The reader comes away from the experience with the impression of having inhabited, in deep empathetic understanding, a life made from art.&#34; - Kirby Gann, Author, Ghosting and Our Napoleon in Rags</p><h2>Bicycling The Pacific Coast: A Complete Route Guide, Canada to Mexico, 4th Edition</h2><p>* Bicycle touring the Pacific Coast is outlined in one trip or four separate adventures<br>* Road directions, points of interest, and available restrooms and provisions all built into daily mileage logs <br>* Elevation profiles and Table of Essentials overview for each day's ride<br><br>From Canada to the Mexican border, <em>Bicycling the Pacific Coast</em> is the most popular guidebook to bicycle touring this gorgeous edge of the U.S. Tom Kirkendall and Vicky Spring guide you turn by turn along the length of Pacific Coast Bicycle Route -- all 1816.5 miles.

Once we feel them in the present, we can come to terms with them and put them in their proper perspective. We can use our energies to truly enter into the moment with all our awareness. The quality of our happiness lies in our ability to experience what is around us. Feelings are often attached to roles. When we experiment with different roles we gain information about our personal history and play with new possibilities for change. Games help us to increase concentration, develop thinking skills and to coordinate thought, emotion and action. They are a way to allow humor and fun to enter into the therapeutic process. This book is designed to help participants get in touch with and express buried feelings in a safe and structured way and to offer training in the ability to be creative and spontaneous.</p><p><p>TIAN DAYTON, MA, PH.D.T.E.P is the author of fifteen books most recently The ACoA Trauma Syndrome, &nbsp;Emotional Sobriety,Trauma and Addiction:, Forgiving and Moving On, The Living Stage, and Relationship Trauma Repair, a model for using sociometry and psychodrama to resolve issues related to relationship trauma.<br><br>Tian Dayton has a masters in educational psychology and a PhD in clinical psychology, is a board certified trainer in psychodrama and a licensed creative arts therapist.

They are a natural way of bonding a group and creating trust. They provide an opportunity to experiment with ourselves and others while still in a safe environment.</p> <p>In our work-oriented culture we leave little time for nongoal-oriented activity such as play and celebration. We have put ourselves in a bind. We have created the most affluent and privileged lifestyle in the world but we lack the time and ability to relax and enjoy it.</p> <p>Games not only help us explore ourselves, they are a re-training in spontaneity, deepening our ability to experience and enjoy life.</p><br><br><b>The Games</b><br> <p>There are two types of games in this book. First there are group games that are led by a facilitator and done by the group as a whole.</p> <p>Second there are individual pieces either done during group by each group member and then shared with the group, or taken home and then shared with a therapist or brought back to the group.</p> <p>Use this book as you would a cookbook. Cull from it what you like and vary it wherever you feel like doing so. It should give you the basic information you need and provide a point of departure.</p><br><br><b>Goals</b><br> <p>Experiential games can be very useful in moving a group gently into action. They enable a group to break down initial inhibitions quickly and begin to feel comfortable. A therapist also has a chance to watch how group members behave in the large group games and in the individual pieces that are shared with the group. Thus the games provide a structure for the therapist to get to know group members and the group members to know one another in a non-threatening way.</p><br><br><b>Role Of The Group Leader</b><br> <p>The therapist's job is to create a supportive, safe situation in which self-discovery through experimentation can happen. As J. L. Moreno, the father of psychodrama says, "The stage is enough.� The therapist acts as a catalyst between the player and the environment, helping the player help themself by offering the stage as a mirror where the player can experience himself.</p> <p>Simply speaking out and being heard or seen, without comment or judgment, is part of the work and healing in these games. The opportunity to experiment with different roles, to "try them for size,� moving in and out of them in a game-like way is important here. The re-education of spontaneity, allowing the "inner child" to become a part of the life of the adult, happens naturally in a playful atmosphere.</p> <p>The role of the group leader is to be supportive and give each player the feeling that what they present to the group will not be judged harshly. It is also necessary for the leader to create respect for the ground rules and enforce them.</p><br><br><b>Creating The Atmosphere</b><br> <p>The most successful approach to any creative effort lies in drawing on the talent and ideas of the individual. As the leader you will want the environment to be very affirmative. Encourage the players to make mistakes and take risks. We want to create a safe space in which the players will feel free to experiment.</p> <p>Remember, this manual can be used in either a group setting or with an individual. It can be used:</p> <blockquote> <ol> <li><i>To sharpen communication skills and enhance self-esteem</i> &#x2015; According to current research citing reasons for drug abuse among young people, the most consistent characteristic is low self-esteem. Games help people learn to be in touch with their feelings and give them safe ways to express those feelings, understand and accept them, and build self-esteem. Communication happens on all levels, through body language, voice and attitude. Drama games teach people to communicate more fully and accurately by expanding their repertoire of ideas. It helps them put thought into action through a conscious process that is within their control.<br><br> </li><li><i>As a stress-reducing activity</i> &#x2015; Stress among adults and children is an increasing concern in our society. Adults and children, particularly beginning in pre-adolescence, need activities that help them relax, unwind and enter into that life-giving activity &#x2015; play. Often our work and school structure systematically removes play from our lives until, as adults, we lose the art entirely and later make awkward attempts to reintroduce it into our lives. Drama games keep play alive.<br><br> </li><li><i>As therapy for adults</i> &#x2015; The play and spontaneity that has been lost in adulthood can be recaptured through drama games. Part of the therapy process is reawakening the "inner child" that has become lost to the adult. We were all children once and we carry that child within us always. If we negate that part of ourselves, we lose our feeling and spontaneity. People who have had great emotional stress or problems often need to validate and recover that part of themselves on their journey to wellness. Drama games offer a safe and structured environment in which to experiment with mood and physical variation.<br><br> </li><li><i>In the classroom</i> &#x2015; Basically this is designed for the classroom teacher who does not have formal drama training. It is used as a new approach to the curriculum being offered and to provide "drama breaks.� A "drama break� can provide (a) a change of mood, (b) relaxation and rejuvenation, (c) a safe arena in which to share ideas or feeling, and (d) an introduction to creative work. Probably the most important ingredient in the teaching of drama or its use in the classroom is the attitude of the teacher. Too much freedom can make the work soggy and directionless, too little can make it lifeless and strained. The position of the teacher should be a bit like a spotter in gymnastics. The teacher stands ready to support if necessary. She supervises the situations, provides guidelines and ground rules; but she knows the real impetus will have to come from the children. She can play a very important role in encouraging the children. It also is important that the teacher constantly scan the group, moving in and out of the roles of both quiet guide and active leader. Activities should come one after the other without a break in pattern that will destroy continuity and concentration.<br><br> </li><li><i>As a "take home" or "learning center" activity</i> &#x2015; Some of the material in this manual does not need to be done with a leader. The guided imageries, for example, can be made into a "learning center" activity. Either the leader or the student can record the "guided imagery" onto a cassette tape: Sound effects or music can be used to make the tape more fun. Then the leader can make the booklet to go with the tape using the examples in the back of the manual. The booklet can include any questions the leader feels are relevant. It is an opportunity for the leader to be creative and to tailor the material to the needs of the group. The book can be photocopied so that each participant will have his or her own. In individual or group therapy the tapes and booklets can be given out by the therapist. I recommend having the cassette and booklets in a flat basket on a shelf along with some colored markers that the players can use for the pictures. The students can remove it from the shelf whenever they desire (along with a cassette recorder) and go off into a private corner to do their own work. They may wish to do this with a friend or in a small group.<br><br> </li><li><i>As a personal performance piece</i> &#x2015; The more comfortable people become thinking on their feet and delivering before others, the more self-esteem they will build. Personal drama pieces give them great control over what they present and how they present it than in a more structured play and it serves the additional purpose of getting them involved on a deeper level with the material they are presenting. Use the examples for mounting a "Personal Piece"; it will be challenging and stimulating to children and grownups alike.<br><br> </li><li><i>Games with variations</i> &#x2015; The variations at the bottom of each game are one of the most important parts. This is the section that allows the leader to expand in any direction that seems useful or appropriate. The creativity and sensitivity of the leader is always the most important part of any material used. Allow yourself to shine through and have fun with it &#x2015; the players will be sure to follow you deep into the work.</li></ol><br><br><b>Ground Rules For The Classroom</b><br> <p><i>Respect for everyone�s ideas:</i> This is important in providing a safe space. Children's ideas and feelings are very closely connected and if we laugh at or discount their ideas they will feel laughed at and discounted personally. To create an atmosphere in which they will feel free to open up we need to show them respect even if a means being a little extra patient.</p> <p><i>A think tank atmosphere:</i> This means we try to say our idea in just a few sentences and that no one will respond to it as being good or bad; it is simply an idea put out and listened to with no comment or discussion. This will free up the children.</p> <p><i>No cross-talk or analyzing another�s work:</i> After the initial sharing, cross-talk is any comment made about the shared material. If we get involved with cross-talk we will change the sharing format to a discussion group which is quite a different atmosphere.</p> <p><i>Focus on the subject at hand.</i> The subject here is creative work and communication. If the subject veers into other areas gently bring it back. Handle this carefully because an atmosphere that is too authoritarian will be stifling.</p> <p><i>No dominating of the group by more aggressive children:</i> Frequently one or two children will not know what to do with themselves in a quiet centered atmosphere and will act out. Try to keep them in touch with the group; they may need a little extra reassurance that it is all right to do this sort of thing. If you absolutely must you can remove them for a few minutes then welcome them back as soon as possible.</p> <p><i>Take a different approach to the subject matter being taught:</i> Teachers, like all of us, get stuck. This will often result in the children getting stuck as well. Children tend to prefer the subjects that teachers love. So use this material to develop new ways of seeing and approaching any subject that you feel it can be applied to.</p> <p><i>Close with group sharing:</i> Wherever you feel it is appropriate after group work, finish by asking people to share what they experienced from the work. Sharing is not a time to give advice or criticism. Rather begin by saying "What came up for me ..� or "How this operates in my life ..� or share in a letter form saying Dear (the main participant) and at the end of the share sign off giving the name of the sharer. Group members who may have played a role other than themselves may use this time to de-role saying "Hi (name of main participant), I'm not (name of role), I'm (sharer's own name).�</p><br><br> &nbsp;<br> <p>(c)1990.

Yet the way one goes about this work, contends Lovett H. Weems, Jr., is anything but simple. It involves walking a tightrope between continuity and change. The task is neither to repeat the past, nor to ignore it. Rather the need is to locate the genius behind the achievements of the past from which we can learn for our day. It is to choose selectively those themes and emphases of the Wesleyan movement that can best inform the practice of ministry today, and to seek to grow into them. In order to achieve this, Weems identifies such principles of early Wesleyanism as beginning with where people are, focusing on service, and remembering the poor. He then enumerates practices of Wesleyan leadership, such as leading from the center and the edge, living in tension, and making &#34;connection&#34; happen. Finally, he names the core passions of the Wesleyan spirit: knowing God, proclaiming Christ, and seeking justice.</p><p>Lovett H. Weems Jr. is distinguished professor of church leadership and director of the Lewis Center for Church Leadership at WesleyTheological Seminary in Washington, D.C. He came to this position in 2003 after 18 years as president of Saint Paul School of Theology in Kansas City, Missouri. A native of Mississippi, Dr. Weems is a graduate of Millsaps College; Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University; and Wesley Theological Seminary. The author of several books published by Abingdon Press, his most recent includes <em>Bearing Fruit: Ministry with Real Results</em> (with Tom Berlin) and a revised edition of his classic, <em>Church Leadership: Vision, Team, Culture, and Integrity</em>. He co-edits the online newsletter <em>Leading Ideas</em>, available free at ChurchLeadership.com.</p><h2>Smuggler&#39;s End: The Life and Death of Barry Seal</h2><p><p><em><strong>The truth behind the CIA/Mena Conspiracy!</strong></em></p> <p>Notorious Louisiana drug smuggler Barry Seal made countless runs from Central America to the United States, flying thousands of pounds of cocaine and marijuana into the country and making millions of dollars. When faced with criminal prosecution, Seal turned snitch for the DEA, but he continued to smuggle drugs into the US. In the 1980s, it was leaked under the Reagan administration that Seal was an undercover CIA operative working with the US government to aid Nicaragua in its fight against the Sandinistas. Seal&#x2019;s role in the conspiracy is large, and many FBI, CIA, DEA, and government officials are implicated in this expos�. Author Del Hahn reveals the true story of this infamous figure.</p></p><p><p>Adler Berriman &#x201c;Barry&#x201d; Seal had a brief, but spectacular, career as a cocaine smuggler-turned DEA informant. Many believe that in addition to his dealings with the DEA, Seal was a CIA operative working with Col. Oliver North in Nicaragua to help the Contras in the fight against the Sandinistas. During the Reagan administration, Seal&#x2019;s infamous undercover role was leaked to Edmond Jacoby of the <i>Washington Post,</i> in hopes that Congress would continue to fund the Contras.</p><p>Meanwhile, the federal drug task force was waging its &#x201c;War on Drugs,&#x201d; and one of their biggest targets was Seal. The Middle District of Louisiana, Western District of Arkansas, New Orleans drug task force, Baton Rouge task force, and other federal agencies all investigated him. But once the story of his CIA involvement leaked, he was no longer useful to the DEA as a poster-boy snitch. Although Seal avoided a prison sentence, the judge ordered him to spend his nights for six months in a Baton Rouge halfway house as a condition of the five-year probationary sentence his plea agreement called for. This decision was fatal. Columbian drug lords were out to kill him, and they succeeded in 1986.</p><p>The books on the market about Seal perpetuate the belief that he was indeed a CIA operative. Author Del Hahn presents credible evidence and facts that dispel the fiction, falsehood, and half-truths surrounding this notorious figure.</p><p>A former Marine and retired FBI agent, Del Hahn is self-employed as a private investigator. He is the contract investigator for one of his clients, the Louisiana State Board of Private Investigator Examiners. After joining the FBI as a special agent, Hahn&#x2019;s first assignment was on a general criminal squad in Florida. After he was transferred to Baton Rouge, he focused on white-collar crime, political corruption, and the newly enacted Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. During his last two years as an agent, Hahn was assigned as the FBI representative to the Middle District of Louisiana Organized Crime Drug Task Force targeting Barry Seal.</p><p>Tom Aswell graduated from Louisiana Tech University in 1970 with a BA in journalism. After his discharge from the United States Air Force, he worked as a reporter and editor for several Louisiana newspapers, including the <i>Baton Rouge Advocate, Ruston Daily Leader,</i> and <i>Monroe News-Star.</i> In addition, Aswell writes a political blog called <i>LouisianaVoice,</i> which was named by the Washington Post as one of the top 100 political blogs in the nation. He is the author of <i><b>Louisiana Rocks! The True Genesis of Rock and Roll</b></i> and the editor of <i><b>With Edwards in the Governor&#x2019;s Mansion: From Angola to Free Man,</b></i> both published by Pelican.</p><p>&#x201c;Barry Seal, the charismatic narcotics air smuggler of the early 1980s, was daring and elusive. When the federal government declared &#x2018;war on drugs,&#x2019; FBI agent Del Hahn, a former Marine of the Korean War era, joined the battle. Hahn is a longtime friend, and I knew Barry Seal. <em><strong>Smuggler&#x2019;s End</strong></em> penetrates the mysteries surrounding Seal, what he did in Mena, Arkansas, and presents the real facts beyond the popular fictional accounts.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;William R. &#x201c;Rut&#x201d; Whittington, Louisiana State Police colonel/superintendent (retired), US marshal &#x2013; Western District of Louisiana (retired)</p> <p>&#x201c;Retired FBI agent Del Hahn provides a behind-the-scenes, inside look at the highly scrutinized life and death of Barry Seal. The book addresses much of the innuendo and many of the myths surrounding the convicted drug smuggler who has been linked to alleged conspiracy theories and has been the subject of much conjecture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jay Dardenne, former lieutenant governor, Louisiana</p> <p>&#x201c;As an investigative reporter who exposed but one small piece of this tale (for <em>Time</em> magazine) more than two decades ago, I've been waiting for years for such a book. Del Hahn takes no prisoners. He has blown apart the Mena Myth and the scoundrels who perpetuate it. The public should be grateful.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Richard Behar, award-winning investigative journalist</p> <p>Despite countless books on Seal, none have ever been able to definitively prove whether he was a paid informant for the CIA or if he was merely a scapegoat for a larger government plot. Retired FBI agent Del Hahn sets the record straight using case documents and first-person accounts, introducing the world to the real Barry Seal.</p></p><h2>The Great Angel: A Study of Israel&#39;s Second God</h2><p><p>What did "Son of God," "Messiah," and "Lord," mean to the first Christians when they used these words to describe their beliefs about Jesus? In this book Margaret Barker explores the possibility that, in the expectations and traditions of first-century Palestine, these titles belonged together, and that the first Christians fit Jesus' identity into an existing pattern of belief. She claims that pre-Christian Judaism was not monotheistic and that the roots of Christian Trinitarian theology lie in a pre-Christian Palestinian belief about angels--a belief derived from the ancient religion of Israel, in which there was a "High God" and several "Sons of God." Yahweh was a son of God, manifested on earth in human form as an angel or in the Davidic King. Jesus was a manifestation of Yahweh, and was acknowledged as Son of God, Messiah, and Lord. Barker relies on canonical and deutero-canonical works and literature from Qumran and rabbinic sources to present her thoughtful investigation.</p></p><p><b>Margaret Baker</b> is a Methodist preacher and biblical scholar. A former president of the Society for Old Testament Study, in July 2008 she was awarded a Doctor of Divinity Lambeth degree by the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p><h2>Rightly Dividing the Word</h2><p>Fully illustrated edition. "The Author started to prepare an "A," "B," "C," book to introduce his larger Work on "DISPENSATIONAL TRUTH," but after writing and condensing several times he felt led to abandon that idea and to prepare a book on "Rightly Dividing the Word," in which the "Fundamental Doctrines" should be "Rightly Divided" in a series of contrasts. The "Fundamental Doctrines" of the Christian Faith are clearly outlined in numerous books on Theology, but they are not available to the average reader and were mainly written for students. The Author has made it the work of his ministry to preach the "Fundamental Doctrines." To this end he has aimed to express them in the simplest and clearest manner possible. This book contains the cream and meat of his sermons for over thirty-five years, condensed and arranged in a form that will grip and interest the reader, because of the manner of their presentation. The Charts are clear and simple and add much to the value of the book, and will be suggestive to Preachers and Bible Teachers in presenting the "Fundamentals." The book does not contain the opinions of the Author, nor quotations from other writers, but is based solely on the Scriptures, chapter and verse being given for every statement. The book is "Timely" in these days of Apostasy and denial of THE FAITH. The purpose of the book is to confirm in the Faith those who are wavering, and to instruct those who have not been clearly taught the great cardinal Doctrines of the Christian Faith." THE AUTHOR, Clarence Larkin (1850&#x2013;1924) was an American Baptist pastor, Bible teacher and author.

The slave uprising in Haiti was a momentous contribution to the tide of revolution that swept over the Western world at the end of the 1700s. A brutal rebellion that strove to overturn a vicious system of slavery, the uprising successfully transformed Haiti from a European colony to the world&#x2019;s first Black republic. From the center of this horrific maelstrom, the heroic figure of Toussaint Louverture&#x2013;a loyal, literate slave and&nbsp;both a devout Catholic and Vodouisant&#x2013;emerges as the man who will take the merciless fires of violence and vengeance and forge a revolutionary war fueled by&nbsp;liberty and equality. <br><br> Bell assembles a kaleidoscopic portrait of this seminal movement through a tableau of characters that encompass black, white, male, female, rich, poor, free and enslaved. Pulsing with brilliant detail, <i>All Soul&#x2019;s Rising</i> provides a visceral sense of the pain, terror, confusion, and triumph of revolution.</p><p>In his breathtaking and powerful novel that garnered nominations for both the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award, Madison Smartt Bell leaves the dark contemporary world he has so brilliantly made his own in nine previously acclaimed novels and short story collections, such as Save Me, Joe Louis. Now he turns to the past and brings viscerally to life the slave rebellion that would bring an end to the white rule of Haiti in the late eighteenth century. The result is an explosive, epic historical novel of astonishing depth and range, catapulting Bell into the ranks of the finest living authors.ost prolific and gifted writers at work today presents an epic novel of astonishing depth and range about the black uprising in Haiti 200 years ago. A remarkable retelling of an episode of racial hatred at its most visceral and most unimaginably destructive, All Souls' Rising is Bell's most ambitious, most deeply satisfying novel to date.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Brian Eno&#39;s Another Green World (33 1/3 series)</h2><p><p>The serene, delicate songs on Another Green World sound practically<br>meditative, but the album itself was an experiment fueled by<br>adrenaline, panic, and pure faith.

The first three color catalogs -- designed by Wayne Husted in 1959, 1960, and 1961 -- show some of the best of Blenko&#39;s early glass production, and these are featured in this latest Blenko book. The year 1983 marked the beginning of the &#34;late&#34; period when the label was changed from the silver foil hand to the square with large B and red dot. The early years of the 1940s through the 1960s have been the most popular with collectors of Blenko Glass. However, interest in later Blenko has already awakened with the other Schiffer books on Blenko and with exposure on PBS videos. For the collector, current market values of this beautiful glass are included. Don Shepherd, Hank Adams, and Matt Carter were the staff designers responsible for all of the later glass in the catalogs. Many of their designs were inspired by those of their predecessors -- those great designers of &#34;cool 50s and 60s glass&#34; -- Winslow Anderson, Wayne Husted, and Joel Myers. Others are bound to become classics on their own merits.</p><p>Leslie Pina, Ph.D heads the Historic Preservation program at Ursuline College in Pepper Pike, Ohio and is an authority on 20th-century decorative art, especially furniture and glass.

One of the art world&#x2019;s most recognizable and popular styles, Impressionism is also one of the most complex. In this sumptuous overview Norbert Wolf lends his attention to all aspects of Impressionism: its historical precursors, contemporary rivals, and the movements it inspired. Over 200 large format reproductions of entire works and highlighted details introduce readers to the Impressionists&#x2019; aesthetics and techniques. Wolf draws insightful parallels between these paintings and other<br>contemporary works of music, photography, and literature. Tracing the movement&#x2019;s expansion from France to the rest<br>of Europe and North America, this volume shines a spotlight on the main protagonists who were key in the development of Impressionism. It highlights not only the French pioneers&#x2015;Claude Monet, Gustave Caillebotte, �douard Manet, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, and others&#x2015;but also Max Liebermann, Lovis Corinth, John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt, William Merritt Chase, and James McNeill Whistler, to name a few. As luxurious as it is authoritative, this wide-ranging investigation of a moment in art history reveals works and ideas that will surprise even the most seasoned aficionado.</p><p>Norbert Wolf is an art historian who lectures frequently. His many publications include Art Deco, Art Nouveau, and Albrecht Durer (all by Prestel)."Starting in France, this global view of Impressionism wraps in painters and photographers from the United States, Scandinavia, Russia and throughout Europe. It deals with the familiar stylistic tics (flickering brush strokes, watery light), topics (dance halls, gardens, flowers) and even the art dealers and collectors who popularized the style." <p>&#x2015;<i>StarTribune</i></p><br><br>"[Thomas] Wolf, German art historian and author (<i>Art Deco</i>), has created another splendidly illustrated tome on an iconic art movement. . . . Wolf explores style, context, themes, the use of color and light, and the expansion of the movement beyond French borders. . . . Large color prints appear on nearly every page. In fact, the dust jacket is so magnificent, one might think a Monet painting was cut from the frame and wrapped around the book. Over 215 illustrations represent impressionist artists from Bazille to Whistler." <p>&#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p></p><h2>Wounded: A Novel</h2><p><p><b><i>Time Out Chicago</i>, Top 10 Book of 2005</b><br><b>Winner of the 2006 PEN USA Literary Award for Fiction</b><br><b> </b><br><b>New paperback edition available!</b></p><p>Training horses is dangerous&#x2015;a head-to-head confrontation with 1,000 pounds of muscle and little sense takes courage, but more important, patience and smarts.

The gentle beep of the monitors, the quiet scrape of nurses&#x2019; shoes on the tiled floor, muted voices in the corridors. She was lulled away from the pain into a restless sleep. Safe, she thought as she drifted away. </p><p>"Where&#x2019;s my wife! I have to see my wife!" </p><p>The frantic voice startled Mary Grace from her doze. She tried to open her eyes then remembered they were still swollen shut. He&#x2019;s here. </p><p>Someone had detained him. Someone with a deep voice that carried across the small room. Perhaps the doctor. Yes, that must be it. </p><p>"You need to go slowly, Officer Winters. Your wife needs you to be calm." </p><p>"What happened? Let me go! I&#x2019;ve got to see Mary Grace!" </p><p>"Your wife has had a serious accident. She doesn&#x2019;t look very good." </p><p>"What..." She heard him clear his throat. "How bad is she hurt?" </p><p>Mary Grace strained to hear. How bad was she hurt? The sharp pain in her head and arm threatened to fill her consciousness. The rest of her body felt numb. Probably the painkillers, she thought, battling the fog that loomed. </p><p>"She has a broken arm, so severely broken we had to pin it in two places. Her right leg is broken. We had to pin it as well, right above the knee. Multiple contusions on her face and to the back of her head. She has a deep cut over her eye. A fraction of an inch lower and she might have lost her eye." </p><p>Mary Grace fought the shudder. It hurt far too much to jar her head, even involuntarily. </p><p>"But she&#x2019;ll be all right." She heard the desperation in her husband&#x2019;s voice. </p><p>The long pause set Mary Grace&#x2019;s heart racing. </p><p>"She&#x2019;ll be all right, won&#x2019;t she? Dammit, Doctor, tell me the truth!" </p><p>Yes, please do, Mary Grace thought. And hurry. The numbness was already enveloping her once more. </p><p>"Your wife fell down a flight of stairs, Officer Winters. She fractured her back at the ninth vertebrae. She lay there unconscious a long time, her spinal cord pinched." </p><p>"Oh my God." </p><p>Her racing heart went still. It was a moment before she took another breath and that one was forced. </p><p>"She has ... there is some paralysis." </p><p>Oh my God, Mary Grace thought. Oh my God. </p><p>"Is it ... permanent?" </p><p>"That&#x2019;s hard to say at this stage. We need to let the swelling subside, then we&#x2019;ll get a spinal cord injury specialist in from Raleigh to take a good look at your wife." </p><p>"Can ... can I see her?" </p><p>"Only for a few minutes. I&#x2019;ll just wait here." </p><p>She could hear him shuffle into the hospital room, his cowboy boots rasping against the tile. Then she could smell him, that intense aftershave he&#x2019;d always worn. Then she could feel his heat as his large body hunkered down. </p><p>"Gracie," he said sorrowfully. "Mary Grace, what have you done to yourself, honey?" His big fingers brushed over the back of her hand, sending chills up the back of her neck. Then he was leaning forward, his lips brushing against her cheek. His mustache tickled her skin as he kissed his way from her cheek to her ear. </p><p>Then it came. She&#x2019;d been waiting, knowing it would come. The knowing never lessened the dread. </p><p>"One word," he breathed into her ear, so low no one would be able to hear. "One word from your idiot mouth and next time I&#x2019;ll finish the job, I swear t&#x2019;God." He nuzzled, his lips seemingly caressing her outer ear. "Understand?" </p><p>Mary Grace managed to tilt her pounding head enough to please him and he straightened, his hand passing over her hair, imperceptibly tightening to yank. Nausea rolled through her stomach. </p><p>"Oh, Gracie, darlin&#x2019;. I just can&#x2019;t stand to see you this way." </p><p>Her body instinctively shrank from his mournful tone, aching with every clench of her muscles. </p><p>"That&#x2019;s all the time you have today, Officer Winters. Why don&#x2019;t you just go on back to the station and we&#x2019;ll call you if there&#x2019;s any change? Or better yet, go on home." </p><p>"I will." His heavy sigh rent the air. "Where&#x2019;s the boy?" </p><p>Her racing heart jittered to a stop once again. Robbie. Where was Robbie? A dim memory mocked. Robbie, holding her hand, begging her not to die, begging her to wait for the ambulance. Was that this time or the time before? She struggled against the mind-numbing effects of the medication, needing to know who had her son. </p><p>"He&#x2019;s with the hospital social worker. He found her, you know. That kind of shock can cause a great emotional trauma in a boy his age." </p><p>Rob&#x2019;s harsh voice carried across the room. He&#x2019;s standing by the doctor now, she thought. He&#x2019;s leaving. He&#x2019;ll be alone with my son. "He&#x2019;s a strong boy. He&#x2019;ll survive." </p><p>Mary Grace felt her hands grip the sheet, twist it until her fingers ached. Detached. She felt detached from her own mind. Helpless in her own body. He&#x2019;ll survive. He has to. Please, Robbie, just hang on &#x2018;till I can get home. </p><p>And then life will be different. She would protect herself. She would protect her son. She vowed Rob Winters would never hurt them again. But how? </p><p>I&#x2019;ll find a way.</p></p><h2>The Last Days of New Paris: A Novel</h2><p><b>A thriller of war that never was&#x2014;of survival in an impossible city&#x2014;of surreal cataclysm.

Beyond a wall of ripped-�up city, the Nazis were shooting.<br><br>Past the barricade and a line of tailors&#x2019; mannequins assembled in a crude and motionless cancan, Thibaut could see the khaki of scattering Wehrmacht men, gray dress uniforms, SS black, the blue of the Kriegsmarine, all lit up by the flares of weapons. Something sped along the rue de Paradis, weaving in a howl of rubber between bodies and ruins, coming straight at the Germans.<br><br>Two women on a tandem? They came very fast on big wheels.<br><br>The soldiers shot, reloaded, and ran because the rushing vehicle did not turn or fall under their onslaught. There was a whir of chains.<br><br>Only one woman rode, Thibaut made out. The other was a torso, jutted from the bicycle itself, its moving prow, a figurehead where handlebars should be. She was extruded from the metal. She pushed her arms backward and they curled at the ends like coral. She stretched her neck and widened her eyes.<br><br>Thibaut swallowed and tried to speak, and tried again, and screamed, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the V�lo!&#x201d;<br><br>At once his comrades came. They pressed against the big window and stared down into the city gloom.<br><br>The Amateur of Velocipedes. Lurching through Paris on her thick-�spoked wheels singing a song without words. My God, Thibaut thought, because a woman was riding her, and that absolutely should not happen. But there she was, gripping the V�lo&#x2019;s wrist with one hand, pulling with the other on leather strapped tight around the cycle-�centaur&#x2019;s throat.<br><br>The V�lo moved faster than any car or horse, any devil Thibaut had yet seen, swaying between the fa�ades, dodging bullets. She tore through the last of the men and the line of figurines they&#x2019;d arranged. She raised her front wheel and hit the barricade, mounted the meters of plaster, stone, bone, wood, and mortar that blocked the street.<br><br>She rose. She hurled into the air above the soldiers, arced up, seeming to pause, falling at last through the invisible boundary between the ninth and tenth arrondissements. She landed hard on the Surrealist side of the street.<br><br>The V�lo bounced and twisted on her tires, slid sideways. She came to a stop, looking up at the window of the Main � plume&#x2019;s hideout, straight into Thibaut&#x2019;s eyes.<br><br>He was first out of the room and down the splintering steps, almost falling from the doorway out into the darkening street. His heart shook him.<br><br>The passenger was sprawled on the cobbles where her mount had bucked. The V�lo reared above her on her hind wheel like a fighting horse. She swayed.<br><br>She looked at Thibaut with pupil-�less eyes the same color as her skin. The manif flexed her thick arms and reached up to snap the cord around her neck and let it fall. She rocked in the wind.<br><br>Thibaut&#x2019;s rifle dangled in his hands. At the edge of his vision he saw �lise lob a grenade over the barricade, in case the Germans were regrouping. The explosion made the ground and the barrier tremble, but Thibaut did not move.<br><br>The V�lo tipped forward, back onto both wheels. She accelerated toward him but he made himself stay still. She bore down and her wheels were a burr. Adrenaline took him with the certainty of impact, until on a final instant too quick to see she tilted and passed instead so close to him that Thibaut&#x2019;s clothes were tugged in the rush of her air.<br><br>Tires singing, the cycle-�presence wove between the shattered buildings of the Cit� de Tr�vise, into ruins and shadows, out of sight.<br><br>Thibaut at last exhaled. When he could control his shaking, he turned to the passenger. He went to where she lay.<br><br>The woman was dying. She had been hammered by the German fire the V�lo had ignored. Some fleeting influence at that powerful intersection of streets meant all the holes in her flesh were dry and puckered, but blood spilled from her mouth as if insisting on one outlet. She coughed and tried to speak.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you see?&#x201d; �lise was shouting. Thibaut knelt and put his hand on the fallen woman&#x2019;s forehead. The partisans gathered. &#x201c;She was riding the V�lo!&#x201d; �lise said. &#x201c;What does that mean? How in hell did she control it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not well,&#x201d; said Virginie.<br><br>The passenger&#x2019;s dark dress was dirty and ripped. Her scarf spread out on the road and framed her face. She furrowed her brow as if thoughtful. As if considering a problem. She was not much older than Thibaut, he thought. She looked at him with urgent eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s . . . it&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s English,&#x201d; he said quietly.<br><br>C�dric stepped forward and tried to murmur prayers and Virginie shoved him sharply away.<br><br>The dying woman took Thibaut&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;He came. Wolf. Gang.&#x201d; She gasped out little bursts. Thibaut put his ear close to her mouth. &#x201c;Gerhard,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The doctor. The priest.&#x201d;<br><br>She was not looking at him any more, Thibaut realized, but past him, behind him. His skin itched in Paris&#x2019;s attention. He turned.<br><br>Behind the windows of the nearest building, overlooking them, a slowly shifting universe of fetal globs and scratches unfolded. A morass of dark colors, vivid on a blacker dark. The shapes rattled. They tapped the glass. A manif storm had come from within the house to witness this woman&#x2019;s death.<br><br>As everyone gathered watched the black virtue behind the windows, Thibaut felt the woman&#x2019;s fingers on his own. He gripped hers in turn. But she did not want a moment&#x2019;s last solicitude. She pried his hand open. She put something in it. Thibaut felt and knew instantly that it was a playing card.<br><br>When he turned back to her the woman was dead.<br><br>Thibaut was loyal Main � plume. He could not have said why he slipped the card into his pocket without letting his comrades see.<br><br>On the stones under the woman&#x2019;s other hand she had written letters on the road with her index finger as a nib. Her nail was wet with black ink from somewhere, provided by the city in that final moment of her need. She had written two last words.<br><br>FALL ROT.<br>Now it&#x2019;s months later, and Thibaut huddles in a Paris doorway, his hand in his pocket to hold that card again. Over his own clothes he wears a woman&#x2019;s blue-�and-�gold pajamas.<br><br>The sky is screaming. Two Messerschmitts come in below the clouds, chased by Hurricanes. Slates explode under British fire and the planes tear out of their dives. One of the German aircraft coils suddenly back in a virtuoso maneuver with weapons blazing and in a burning gust an RAF plane unfolds in the air, opening like hands, like a blown kiss, fire descending, turning an unseen house below to dust.<br><br>The other Messerschmitt veers toward the Seine. The roofs shake again, this time from below.<br><br>Something comes up from inside Paris.<br><br>A pale tree-�wide tendril, shaggy with bright foliage. It rises. Clutches of buds or fruit the size of human heads quiver. It blooms vastly above the skyline.<br><br>The German pilot flies straight at the vivid flowers, as if smitten, plant-�drunk. He plunges for the vegetation. It spreads trembling leaves. The great vine whips up one last house-�height and takes the plane in its coils. It yanks it down below the roofs, into the streets, out of sight.<br><br>There is no explosion. The snagged aircraft is just gone, into the deeps of the city.<br><br>The other planes frantically disperse. Thibaut waits while they go. He lets his heart slow. When he sets his face and steps out at last it is under a clean sky.<br><br>Thibaut is twenty-�four, hard and thin and strong. His eyes move constantly as he keeps watch in all directions: he has the fretful aggression and the gritted teeth of the new Parisian. He keeps his hair and his nails short. He squints with more than just suspicion: he does not have the spectacles he suspects he might need. Beneath his bright woman&#x2019;s nightclothes he wears a dirty darned white shirt, dark trousers and suspenders, worn black boots. It has been some days since Thibaut has shaved. He&#x2019;s scabbed and stinking.<br><br>Those pilots were foolhardy. Paris&#x2019;s air is full of reasons not to fly.</p><h2>Death Swatch (A Scrapbooking Mystery)</h2><p>Amid Zydeco rhythms and popping champagne corks, scrapbook shop owner Carmela Bertrand is having a wild night at a Mardi Gras party?until she finds a float designer murdered on a balcony.</p><p>Laura Childs is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Cackleberry Club, Tea Shop, and Scrapbooking mysteries.

The little boy with sandy brown hair had already freed himself from the loosened straps and was scrambling across the seat toward the open door.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jumping down to the pavement, Jack started to race toward the group of preschool children already on the outdoor playground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hey, hey! Where's my hug?" Kelly called out, then leaned down toward Jack and held her arms open.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jack turned around, threw both his little arms around Kelly's neck, and gave her a quick hug and a grin. Then he raced off toward the irresistible lure of his friends sliding down the slide, swinging on the swings, and climbing the smaller-sized jungle gym bars.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly grabbed her carryout coffee mug from inside the car, then closed the door and walked over to the preschool parking lot, watching the children play. Another preschool mother strolled over to join her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hi, Kelly," the young woman said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hey there, AnaSofia," Kelly said. "It looks like Jerry's leg has completely recovered. He's barely limping now."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, he'll be limping a lot once he gets back home after preschool. I told him not to run, but he forgets everything I tell him the minute he gets here and sees his friends," she said with a smile.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly gave a short laugh. "I know exactly what you mean. Jack sees kids on a playground-any playground-and he heads straight for them."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Do you have one of those smaller gyms in your backyard?" AnaSofia asked. "I was thinking about getting one since Jerry just loves climbing and going down the slide. Will and I decided we'd get a set for the yard."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, we have one, and Jack really uses it. He's even taken some wooden blocks outside and built things under the slide in the shade. He loves playing out there during the summertime."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I think you said Jack would be going to kindergarten next year, right?" AnaSofia asked, glancing toward Kelly. "Will and I don't know if we should send Jerry then or not. Some of my friends are holding their boys back for another year so they'll be older. Jerry won't be five until August next year."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yes, Jack will be starting kindergarten next year, and he'll be five in May. He can't wait to get there. Jack plays with a friend's little five-year-old girl, Molly, and she is constantly telling Jack what they're doing in kindergarten and showing him things she's made." Kelly laughed softly as she stared into the playground. "Steve and I call her Miss Molly because she loves to organize things. Then show everyone what she's doing and talk a mile a minute."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AnaSofia smiled. "That sounds like one of my neighbor's kids. Brian will talk your ear off whenever he comes over to play and asks questions. He wants to know everything you're doing and why, even if you're just raking leaves in the fall." She laughed out loud.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That sounds exactly like Miss Molly. Molly is, well, kind of bossy. Jack just ignores a lot of what she's telling him." Kelly chuckled, recalling many of Molly's moments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A phone's musical ring sounded, playing an old country music song. AnaSofia grabbed it before the male singer started the chorus. "Hey there," she said, giving Kelly a smiling wave as she turned away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly waved in return and walked back to her no-longer-shiny-new sports wagon. Client accounts were calling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Retired Fort Connor police detective Burt Parker stood on the sidewalk that bordered the garden patio of Kelly�s favorite local yarn and knitting shop, Lambspun of Colorado. The garden patio was filled with customers clearly enjoying lunch or a late breakfast while seated at caf&#x17d; tables scattered around the picturesque patio under the trees and in the sun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A take-out cup in his hand, Burt smiled at Kelly as she exited her car. "I've often wondered if you ever miss your sporty little red car, Kelly. I still haven't gotten used to seeing you drive up to the shop in a family car."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly glanced back at the sports wagon. Three years old now and worn in with a growing toddler turned preschooler-definitely a family car.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No room in the red car for a child seat," Kelly said with a grin. "A cute sporty car was fun but didn't work for a family."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well, you're right about that. My daughter and son-in-law switched over when she got pregnant the first time. But that was years ago, and there were no 'sporty wagons' then. There were station wagons with three rows of seats." Burt rounded the border sidewalk that led to the front entry of the knitting shop.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Walking beside her dear friend and mentor, Kelly shifted the briefcase bag on her shoulder. "I remember those. We only had my dad's four-door sedan, because he drove to client sites. But some of my school friends had station wagons, and we all loved sitting in the back seat that faced backward. That way we could wave at other drivers."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And make faces. At least, that's what my kids did," Burt said with a laugh as they walked up the brick steps leading to Lambspun's front entry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I refuse to comment, because it would incriminate me," Kelly teased as she walked through the door that Burt held open.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly stepped inside the entry foyer of Lambspun and paused, as she always did, and glanced around at the wonderland of fibers surrounding her. Color, color, everywhere. Pastel pink and blue baby sweaters with tiny buttons were hanging from the ceiling with tags recommending patterns. A delicate multicolored shawl was draped over the top of a bookcase, which held several popular books on knitting, spinning, weaving, and all manner of fiber arts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I see that the Lambspun elves have been busy," Kelly observed as she strolled through the foyer. "There are several new yarns displayed."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh yes. We received a shipment yesterday," Burt said as he followed after her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly stroked a brilliant turquoise skein and read the label. Fifty percent merino wool and fifty percent silk. Her fingers had grown much more sensitive over the years, Kelly noticed, so that she could detect the presence of silk in an unknown skein simply by touch. "That's a striking color," she said before she slowly wandered into the next room straight ahead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly called it the central yarn room because it was filled with bins and shelves that lined every wall. Every bin spilled over with skeins and balls of yarn of every color imaginable. Kelly always loved to stroll through this room and touch, touch, touch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'll tell Mimi you're here," Burt said as he walked toward the adjoining room. Kelly called that room the Loom Room because it held the largest weaving loom in the shop. Beyond that was the front room of Lambspun knitting shop with the winding table as well as the counter with the cash register, plus scores of knitting accessories.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A particularly pretty shade of lime green caught her eye-bright as the limes themselves at the nearby City Market. She fingered the yarn and recognized the familiar touch of pure cotton fiber.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly noticed the caf&#x17d; owner's niece, Cassie, seated at the end of the long library table located in the shop's main knitting room. She had a stack of magazines in front of her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hey there, Cassie. How're you doing?" Kelly asked as she set her travel mug on the long wooden table. The surface was almost completely covered by small containers holding stitch markers, clips, small scissors, stray knitting needles and crochet hooks, plastic containers with homemade cookies, and a raised glass-covered cake dish that was usually filled with homemade cupcakes or other tasty temptations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hi, Kelly," Cassie said, looking up with a smile. "Mimi asked me to find an article on cable knitting she saw in one of these magazines. We have several customers interested in learning the technique."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Cable knitting, huh? That's way over my head, so I certainly won't be any help," Kelly said as she plopped her oversize shoulder bag onto the table and settled into one of the wooden chairs along the side.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You're so funny, Kelly," Cassie said as she paged through the magazine. "I'm sure you could learn any knitting technique out there if you decided to. But you're happy knitting what you know."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bingo. Cassie had nailed Kelly's longtime excuse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well, you've got me there, Cassie," Kelly said with a smile then took a sip of coffee. "Truth is, I just don't have time to learn something new and time-consuming. The only time I have to knit nowadays is when I'm here at the shop." She leaned back into the chair and relaxed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cassie glanced up. "Yeah, I can't picture Jack letting you knit when you're at home."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly nodded. "You got that right. By the way, have you heard anything about your finals?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cassie nodded. "I already got the email from my literature professor, and I finished the class with a score of 92 out of 100. That really helps, because I'm not sure what my grade in chemistry will be. If it's in the 70s range, then that lit grade will help average it out to a B range in the 80s."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You've got that analyzed for sure," Kelly said with a little laugh. "That brings me back to my university days from years ago. How'd Eric do? Or does he not know yet?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cassie leaned back into her chair. "He got an 82 on his anatomy exam and a 70 on his econ. But he's sweating the results of his biochemistry exam."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly made a face. "I don't even want to think about how hard that one would be. I still remember how challenging those university science classes were years ago."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just then, the sound of fast footsteps echoed as Mimi Shafer Parker walked through the central yarn room into the main knitting room. Her cheerful smile made Mimi's seventy years melt away. Kelly marveled that Mimi never looked her real age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well, hello, Kelly. It's good to see you. How's little Jack doing?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Going nonstop as usual," Kelly replied as she relaxed against the chair. "I swear, the only time Jack slows down is when he's sitting on the floor playing with those large building blocks or when he's asleep in his bed at night."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sounds like Jack," Cassie remarked as she flipped through the magazine pages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mimi laughed her little musical laughter, which went up the scale then down again. "Oh, I can picture little Jack now," she said. "I bet he's really enjoying preschool."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh yes. He loves it. They've got some of those extra large plastic building blocks in one of the playrooms. So the kids get to build all sorts of things. One time when I stopped by to bring the class some fruit juice I bought, Jack and his friend Jerry had built some sort of structure about four feet high. Then, another kid in class knocked it down." Kelly chuckled, remembering.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, for goodness' sake," Mimi said with a little frown. "Was Jack upset?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Not for long. Jack and Jerry yelled at the kid, then ran off into the playground and jumped onto the slide." She took a deep drink of coffee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Typical playground drama," Cassie said, reaching for another fiber magazine. "I remember my preschool, years ago. There was one little boy who was a real bully. He used to threaten some of the other kids that he'd beat them up if they didn't give him their snack cookies. Most of them got scared and gave him their cookies. Then one day another kid took a long wooden block and clunked the bully on the back of the head. He burst into tears and never gave anyone any trouble again."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly laughed lightly. "That's a snapshot of real life for sure."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well, let's hope there aren't any mean bullies in little Jack's class," Mimi said in her most maternal tone before she walked into the workroom next door.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cassie glanced to Kelly with a smile. "Mimi is so sweet. She wants to picture everything and everyone in the very best light. Nothing bad ever happening."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly let out a sigh. "I know. Mimi has seen a lot of tragic events in her life. So naturally, she tries to focus on the good things."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cassie peered at Kelly. "I know about Mimi's son dying in the Poudre Canyon when he was at the university. He took drugs at a party one weekend and walked right over the side of a cliff into the ravine and broke his neck. That is so awful. Mimi must have been devastated."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm sure she was. I didn't know her then. In fact, that was so long ago I was probably still in university myself."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cassie's brow arched. "You said that Mimi's seen a lot of 'tragic' things in her life. What were the others?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly hesitated. If she answered Cassie's question honestly, she would be opening a Pandora's box of memories-some happy but others heartbreaking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cassie's gaze narrowed, and she smiled a little. "You're thinking about whether to tell me or not. I can see it on your face, Kelly. You're hesitating."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly had to laugh. "Boy, Cassie, you've learned to read me really well. Can't get away with anything, can I?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Nope," Cassie said with a grin. "So tell me. You're making me really curious."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly laughed again and looked out into the central yarn room beyond. No one else was around. No customers and no browsers. No Lambspun elves were nearby or close to the knitting table, either. She beckoned Cassie closer. "C'mon over here. I'm going to lower my voice. I don't want anyone else to overhear."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cassie immediately jumped up from her chair at the end of the library table and swiftly joined Kelly along the side. She pulled out the chair beside Kelly. "Now I can't wait to hear."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly took a long drink of coffee. She figured she was going to need it to deliberately sort through her memories for some of those traumatic events she and her Lambspun friends had witnessed several years ago. Kelly didn't have to search very far. One of those distant memories suddenly appeared before her eyes. The image of a young woman bent over and floating facedown in one of the basement sinks in the Aztec blue dyed water.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly closed her eyes and quietly repeated what happened years before. "A young college girl was killed in the shop basement late one night, years ago. She was drowned in a sink filled with water . . . and Aztec Blue dye."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cassie's big brown eyes popped wide. "WHAT!" she whispered in a raspy voice. "Who killed her?"</p></p><h2>A Little Girl Dreams of Taking the Veil</h2><p>In the course of browsing an illustrated book of objects&#x2014;umbrellas, watches, tools, clothes&#x2014;artist Max Ernst was struck by the items' unusual juxtapositions. By manipulating the Victorian-era engravings into striking tableaux and adding brief captions, Ernst invented the collage novel and transformed banal advertising art into revealing dramas rooted in his dreams and secret desires. <br><i>A Little Girl Dreams of Taking the Veil</i> was originally published in 1930 as <i>R�ve d'une petite fille qui voulut entrer au Carmel.</i> Its hallucinatory visions center on the nightmares of a girl who loses her virginity on the day of her first communion and resolves to become a nun. Ernst, a pioneer of the Dada movement and Surrealistic art, blends humor and irony in his exploration of the nonrational but very real intersection of religious ecstasy and erotic desire. A century after its debut, this profoundly peculiar book retains its shock value as well as its imaginative power.</p><p>A key figure in the Dadaist and Surrealist art movements, German-born Max Ernst (1891&#x2013;1976) became an American citizen in 1948 and a French citizen in 1958. Painter, sculptor, graphic artist, and poet, Ernst employed the fragmented logic of collage in this volume and in his landmark collage book, &nbsp; <i>Une semaine de bont�,</i> also published by Dover.Text: English, French</p><h2>The Obesogen Effect: Why We Eat Less and Exercise More but Still Struggle to Lose Weight</h2><p><b>An eye-opening account of the landmark research into the hidden chemicals that are endangering our health and keeping us fat.</b><br><br>Being overweight is not just the result of too many cheeseburgers or not enough exercise. According to leading-edge science, a new group of silent saboteurs in our daily lives is contributing greatly to our obesity epidemic: obesogens. These weight-inducing offenders, most of which are chemicals, disrupt our hormonal systems, altering how we create and store fat, and changing how we respond to dietary choices and caloric intake. Because they are largely unregulated, obesogens lurk all around us-in food, furniture, plastic products such as water bottles and food storage containers, and other surprising exposure points. Even worse: research has shown that the effects of some obesogens can be passed on to future generations by irreversibly interfering with the expression of our genes. The good news is we can protect ourselves by becoming more informed consumers.<br><br>In THE OBESOGEN EFFECT, Dr. Bruce Blumberg explains how obesogens work, where they are found, and how we can minimize their effects. Dr. Blumberg offers a highly practical three-step solution for reducing exposures. He explains why one size does not fit all in a weight loss program, what harmful additives are in our household goods, and how we should shop for obesogen-free items we use every day-from vegetables and meats to canned soup as well as household cleaners, air fresheners, and personal care products. THE OBESOGEN EFFECT is an urgent call to action to protect your body, clean up your life, and set a straight course for better health.<br><br></p><p><b>Bruce Blumberg, PhD, </b>has been conducting pioneering research in endocrinology and developmental biology for more than thirty years. He is professor in the Departments of Developmental and Cell Biology, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Biomedical Engineering at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). At UCI, his laboratory studies the biology of nuclear hormone receptors in development, physiology, and disease with a particular emphasis on how these are affected by hormonally active compounds in the diet and environment. In 2012, he was elected as a fellow of the prestigious American Association for the Advancement of Science.<br><b><br></b>"Why do we get hungry, feel tired, and gain weight? A likely culprit is our fat cells. THE OBESOGEN EFFECT, written by the researcher who literally defined this new field, explains how our diet and other exposures can program the body for weight gain-beyond calories in, calories out-and what you can do about it!"&#x2015;<b><i>David Ludwig, MD, PhD, author of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Always Hungry? </i><br><br></i></b><br><br>"If you think obesity is about couch potatoes and gluttony, or calories in vs. calories out, you must think again. Or better yet, read this book. It tells a complex scientific story with vivid, accessible clarity about the role that obesogens-chemical contaminants that can alter our metabolism, appetite and more-play into making us fat. The bad news is that obesogens are all too common and hard to avoid if you aren't paying attention. The book's good news is that there are many simple, practical steps you can take that will protect you and your family." <br>&#x2015;<b><i>John Peterson Myers, PhD, Chief Scientist, Carnegie Mellon University</i></b><br><br>"Every wonder why it is so easy to gain weight and hard to lose it?

Bruce Blumberg makes the case clearly that industrial chemicals cause obesity in a similar way. Bruce is an eminent researcher who, through his discoveries, has changed the way we think about body weight regulation-both in a fundamental way, as well as by providing insight into the role of industrial chemicals.

It was promoted in the 19th century as a way to reconnect "soft" urban Americans with nature and to the legacy of the country's pathfinding heroes. Fair chase, a hunting code of ethics emphasizing fairness, rugged independence, and restraint towards wildlife, emerged as a worldview and gave birth to the conservation movement. But the sport's popularity also caused class, ethnic, and racial divisions, and stirred debate about the treatment of Native Americans and the role of hunting in preparing young men for war.<br> <br>This sweeping and balanced book offers a definitive account of hunting in America. It is essential reading for anyone interested in the evolution of our nation's foundational myths.</p><p><b>Philip Dray</b> is a historian who has written or coauthored seven books on American history and culture, including <i>At the Hands of Persons Unknown</i>, which won the Robert F. Kennedy Book Prize and the Southern Book Critics Circle Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Dray lives in Brooklyn, New York."How hunting came to hold an iconic place in American culture in the first place is an interesting tale, and in <i>The Fair Chase</i> Philip Dray explores it with a balance and fair-mindedness that is unusual for such a contentious subject...The great strength of this telling is the author's ability to see that little about his story is black and white."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Wall Street Journal</b></i><br></i></b><br><br>"Lively and compelling...A capacious and erudite history of the practice and meanings of hunting in American life...Written with sensitivity and bracketed with judgement, it describes a culture and asks questions, telling a story full of paradoxes and nuance...As an unrivaled history, and an admirably crafted bid to deepen dialogue between groups of Americans who might otherwise view one another as alien or out of touch, Dray's <i>Fair Chase</i> is a vital intervention."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>New Republic</b></i><br></i></b><br><br>"Enlightening...<i>The Fair Chase</i> isn't a book about ethics and philosophy, but Dray does a fine job introducing his readers to the issues at play...He isn't afraid to lay out hard truths." <br>&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>New York Times Book Review</b></i><br></i></b><br><br>"An eloquent, thoughtful, and nuanced cultural history of American hunting."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Choice</b></i></i></b><br><br>"A fluid and fascinating history for hunters and nonhunters alike."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Garden &amp; Gun</i></b><br></i></b><br><br>"Revealing...[Dray] does a marvelous job walking us, mostly chronologically, through nearly every aspect and controversy of hunting's long history, with themes of ethics ('fair chase, the idea that hunted animals must have a chance to evade or flee their pursuers') and conservation looming large throughout...A lively history that can be enjoyed by hunters and conservationists alike."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus</i></b></i></b><br><br>"In this well-written, wide ranging history that is at once literary and infused with a passion for wild things, Philip Dray reveals how American sportsmen have continually remade hunting in ways that both expressed and contributed to broader shifts in the nation's culture.

Philip Dray has given us a deeply researched epic story of hunting and the literary tradition that celebrates wilderness, the chase, iconic figures such as Daniel Boone and Sitting Bull, the hunter's code of ethics, the western in print and film, and the continuing romance of firearms, along with animal rights, and meditation on the future of hunting. This is history writing at its exciting best."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Robert Morgan, author of<i> Lions of the West</i></b><br></i></b><br><br>"Less than ten percent of the population now hunts, but they still represent a large symbolic place in our national narrative. Philip Dray helps us understand why hunting and hunters continue to shape our ongoing debates about our relationship to wildlife, endangered species, and environmental policy. Given the dramatic changes in the management ethos of our natural resources brought on by the Trump administration, <i>The Fair Chase</i> is a timely and engaging reminder of what's at stake."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Jan E. Dizard, author of <i>Going Wild</i> and <i>Mortal Stakes</i></b></i></b><br><br>"In <i>The Fair Chase</i>, Philip Dray tells the story, by turns appalling and inspiring, of hunting in the U.S. and how successive waves of media imagery transformed it from simple meat procurement into a recreational activity embodying shifting beliefs about the land and its European conquerors, animals and humans, and humanity and nature.

Ever since physics first penetrated the atom, early in this century, what it found there has stood as a radical and unanswered challenge to many of our most cherished conceptions of nature. It has literally been called into question since then whether or not there are always objective matters of fact about the whereabouts of subatomic particles, or about the locations of tables and chairs, or even about the very contents of our thoughts. A new kind of uncertainty has become a principle of science.</p><p>This book is an original and provocative investigation of that challenge, as well as a novel attempt at writing about science in a style that is simultaneously elementary and deep. It is a lucid and self-contained introduction to the foundations of quantum mechanics, accessible to anyone with a high school mathematics education, and at the same time a rigorous discussion of the most important recent advances in our understanding of that subject, some of which are due to the author himself.</p></p><p>David Z Albert is Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University.&#x201c;Over the past two decades, philosophers of physics have worked long and hard...to extract the philosophical pith from the theoretical physics.

The political order was always tied to an official religion in Christian Europe, pre-Christian Europe, and in the Arabic world. But from the eighteenth century onwards, some European states began to set up their political order on a different basis. Not religion, but the rule of law through non-religious values embedded in constitutions became the foundation of some states - a movement we now call secularism. In others, a de facto secularism emerged as political values and civil and criminal law altered their professed foundation from a shared religion to a non-religious basis. <br><br>Today secularism is an increasingly hot topic in public, political, and religious debate across the globe. It is embodied in the conflict between secular republics - from the US to India - and the challenges they face from resurgent religious identity politics; in the challenges faced by religious states like those of the Arab world from insurgent secularists; and in states like China where calls for freedom of belief are challenging a state imposed non-religious worldview. In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Andrew Copson tells the story of secularism, taking in momentous episodes in world history, such as the great transition of Europe from religious orthodoxy to pluralism, the global struggle for human rights and democracy, and the origins of modernity. He also considers the role of secularism when engaging with some of the most contentious political and legal issues of our time: 'blasphemy', 'apostasy', religious persecution, religious discrimination, religious schools, and freedom of belief and freedom of thought in a divided world.<br><br>Previously published in hardback as <em>Secularism: Politics, Religion, and Freedom</em><br><br>ABOUT THE SERIES: The <em>Very Short Introduction</em>s series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

In these capacities he is one of the most experienced and prolific advocates of secularism, its study, and its implementation. For over a decade he has carried out a range of national and international practical secularist policy work and spoken internationally on secularism. He has been an associate of the Centre for Law and Religion and the University of Cardiff since 2008, and represented the secularist point of view on public or other bodies such as the Foreign Office's Advisory Panel on Freedom of Religion or Belief and the Woolf Institute's Commission on Religion and Belief in British Public Life.

It will be an enormous help to all who want to understand better the current controversies about religious belief and modern society." - Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury<p></p><br>"Secularism is of growing importance all over the world, yet it is also an approach with deep roots reaching far back into our history. Andrew Copson elegantly explores this history as well as secularism's importance today, showing how it evolved and how it is the key to de-escalating so many of the modern world's points of conflict." - Dan Snow<p></p><br></p><h2>How to Study Public Life</h2><p>How do we accommodate a growing urban population in a way that is sustainable, equitable, and inviting? This question is becoming increasingly urgent to answer as we face diminishing fossil-fuel resources and the effects of a changing climate while global cities continue to compete to be the most vibrant centers of culture, knowledge, and finance.<br><br> Jan Gehl has been examining this question since the 1960s, when few urban designers or planners were thinking about designing cities for people. But given the unpredictable, complex and ephemeral nature of life in cities, how can we best design public infrastructure&#x2014;vital to cities for getting from place to place, or staying in place&#x2014;for human use? Studying city life and understanding the factors that encourage or discourage use is the key to designing inviting public space.<br><br> In <i>How to Study Public Life</i> Jan Gehl and Birgitte Svarre draw from their combined experience of over 50 years to provide a history of public-life study as well as methods and tools necessary to recapture city life as an important planning dimension.<br><br> This type of systematic study began in earnest in the 1960s, when several researchers and journalists on different continents criticized urban planning for having forgotten life in the city. City life studies provide knowledge about human behavior in the built environment in an attempt to put it on an equal footing with knowledge about urban elements such as buildings and transport systems. Studies can be used as input in the decision-making process,&nbsp; as part of overall planning, or in designing individual projects such as streets, squares or parks. The original goal is still the goal today: to recapture city life as an important planning dimension. Anyone interested in improving city life will find inspiration, tools, and examples in this invaluable guide.</p><p>Jan Gehl is a founding partner of Gehl Architects&#x2014;Urban Quality Consultants. He is the author of <i>Life Between Buildings</i> and <i>Cities for People</i>. He has received numerous awards for his work and is widely credited with creating and renewing urban spaces in cities around the world, including Copenhagen, Melbourne, New York City, London, and many others.<br><br>Birgitte Bundesen Svarre holds an MA in modern culture from the University of Copenhagen and a PhD from the School of Architecture in Copenhagen. She is part of Gehl Institute, the division at Gehl Architects that works with research and communication of knowledge at workshops for city planners, politicians and others with interest in life in the cities &#x2013; as well as suburbs, a topic she has specialized within. She is a guest lecturer at various universities."fills a gap in the literature...Gehl is an unassuming but essential guide to this criminally underutilized method of analysis." <br> (<i>Planetizen's Top 10 Books of 2014</i>)<br><br>"...it serves also as a knowledge map for those interested in understanding the roots of the renaissance of public spaces as a field of attention in urban planning, looking back at authors that influenced the works not only of Jan Gehl, but also of all those addressing a new understanding of the importance of public life in our cities nowadays." <br> (<i>Ciudades a Escala Humana</i>)<br><br>"In sharing how public life-public space interactions can be systematically approached and taught, I don&#x2019;t hesitate to say that <i>How to Study Public Life</i> is must-read for anybody and everybody entrenched in urban development, design and planning&#x2014;from students and practitioners to municipal officials and policy makers."

And why do migrants to Western countries find that they are at higher risk for this disease after they arrive? T. M. Luhrmann and Jocelyn Marrow&nbsp;argue that the root causes of schizophrenia are not only biological, but also sociocultural.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book gives an intimate, personal account of those living with serious psychotic disorder in the United States, India, Africa, and Southeast Asia. It introduces the notion that social defeat&#x2014;the physical or symbolic defeat of one person by another&#x2014;is a core mechanism in the increased risk for psychotic illness. Furthermore, &#x201c;care-as-usual&#x201d; treatment as it occurs in the United States actually increases the likelihood of social defeat, while &#x201c;care-as-usual&#x201d; treatment in a country like India diminishes it.</p><p>&amp;;These case studies reveal the humanity and resilience of people living with psychotic disorders. Luhrmann and Marrow have collated perceptive and sensitive sketches of the lives of people with psychosis. The material reveals not only how culture shapes the content of delusions and hallucinations, but also how different societies respond to those with psychosis. Just as a prism can refract light into its component wavelengths, psychotic disorders can unexpectedly reveal the influence of cultural factors on the spectrum of thinking and cognition.&amp;;&amp;;John McGrath, Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, Australia<br><br> &amp;;<i>Our Most Troubling Madness</i> is a rich, detailed, textured account of how schizophrenia presents cross-culturally. In several case studies, the contributors lay out in compelling detail how these sufferers conceive of themselves and are conceived of by others, making clear that there are more and less toxic ways to respond to schizophrenia, and that the cultural context gives shape to the illness. The authors not only tell these stories but also draw important lessons for those who suffer with, or help those who suffer with, these sometimes devastating illnesses. A must-read for anyone interested in the presentation of serious mental illness across very different cultures.&amp;;&amp;;Elyn &nbsp;R.

He demonstrates how this conflict, which marked the demise of the first four caliphs, resulted in the lasting schism between Sunnite and Shi&#39;ite Islam. In contrast to recent scholarly trends, the author takes up the Shi&#39;i cause, arguing in defense of the succession of &#39;Ali. This book will make a major scholarly contribution to the debate over succession.</p><p>"The Succession of Muhammad is not a work for the faint of heart....it is a compelling reassessment of the Rashidun caliphate that should be required reading for evryone interested in the historiography of early Islam." James E. Lindsay, MESA Bulletin<br><br>"For those who have been lamenting the decline or near demise of solid, historical narratives, this is a book to cherish." Jane Dammen McAuliffe, Religious Studies Review<br><br>"This erudite, complex, and fascinating book rexamines the struggle over and for the office of caliph. This book performs a valuable service by counter-balancing popular views about the origins and development of Shi`ism." Elton L. Daniel, Middle East Journal<br><br>"Madelung brilliantly dissects the myriad, conflicting accounts of Ali's numerous confrontations, as well as the final one...Bound to provoke controversy, this volume has laid down a marker. Critics will be expected to attain a standard of scholarship considerably more incisive than all too much of what has been available to date." Andrew J. Newman, University of Edinburgh<br><br>"This is a judicious and honestly critical account of monetous events that reflects the weight of information in a wide array of Arabic texts...The response this book should provoke has possibilities for opening up a discussion of the succession to leardership in general at the endof Late Antiquity." Jrnl of Near Eastern Studies</p><h2>Africa&#39;s World War: Congo, the Rwandan Genocide, and the Making of a Continental Catastrophe</h2><p>The Rwandan genocide sparked a horrific bloodbath that swept across sub-Saharan Africa, ultimately leading to the deaths of some four million people. In this extraordinary history of the recent wars in Central Africa, Gerard Prunier offers a gripping account of how one grisly episode laid the groundwork for a sweeping and disastrous upheaval. <br> Prunier vividly describes the grisly aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, when some two million refugees--a third of Rwanda's population--fled to exile in Zaire in 1996. The new Rwandan regime then crossed into Zaire and attacked the refugees, slaughtering upwards of 400,000 people. The Rwandan forces then turned on Zaire's despotic President Mobutu and, with the help of a number of allied African countries, overthrew him. But as Prunier shows, the collapse of the Mobutu regime and the ascension of the corrupt and erratic Laurent-Dsir Kabila created a power vacuum that drew Rwanda, Uganda, Angola, Zimbabwe, Sudan, and other African nations into an extended and chaotic war. The heart of the book documents how the whole core of the African continent became engulfed in an intractible and bloody conflict after 1998, a devastating war that only wound down following the assassination of Kabila in 2001. Prunier not only captures all this in his riveting narrative, but he also indicts the international community for its utter lack of interest in what was then the largest conflict in the world. <br><br><strong>Praise for the hardcover:</strong><br><br>"The most ambitious of several remarkable new books that reexamine the extraordinary tragedy of Congo and Central Africa since the Rwandan genocide of 1994."<br>--<em>New York Review of Books</em><br><br>"One of the first books to lay bare the complex dynamic between Rwanda and Congo that has been driving this disaster."<br>--Jeffrey Gettleman, <em>New York Times Book Review</em><br><br>"Lucid, meticulously researched and incisive, Prunier's will likely become the standard account of this under-reported tragedy."<br>--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><br></p><p><br><strong>Gerard Prunier</strong> is a widely acclaimed journalist as well as Director of the French Centre for Ethiopian Studies in Addis Ababa.

Books on assessment in student affairs tend to discuss processes more than research design and statistics. Most books on statistics share too much information for practitioners, overwhelming them and making it difficult to discern what they need to know. Since these books do not use examples from student affairs, it is even more difficult for practitioners to connect with new concepts.<br><br>Student Affairs professionals need to know how to design a study, collect data, analyze data, interpret results, and present the results in an understandable manner. This book will begin by establishing the need for these skills in student affairs and then quickly move to how to develop a research culture, how to conduct research, how to understand statistics, and concluding with how to change our research/assessment behaviors in order to make higher education better for students.</p><p>Rishi Sriram serves as Associate Professor of Higher Education &amp; Student Affairs, Associate Chair for the Department of Educational Leadership, and Residential College Faculty Steward of Brooks Residential College&#x2013;a living-learning community of approximately 400 students, at Baylor University.

Wawrzynski, Associate Professor and Coordinator Higher, Adult, and Lifelong Education Program <i>Michigan State University, and Executive Editor, Journal of Student Affairs Research and Practice</i> 2017-02-27)<br><br>"<i>Student Affairs by the Numbers</i> couldn&#x2019;t arrive at a better time. The pressure from state-based performance-based funding, increased rigor from regional accrediting agencies, and an increase in a 'return-on-investment' approach to funding and program review underscores the critical importance of developing a core competence in quantitative statistics and assessment. This book is a valuable resource for student affairs professionals and graduate students who are developing research and evaluation efforts on core student affairs programs and services." (Kevin Kruger, President of NASPA &#x2013; Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education 2017-04-03)<br><br>"Our future will be built by student affairs educators who view themselves as scholar-practitioners. The current conditions of higher education require curious professionals who see the many research questions that surround our daily work. Understanding and engaging the science of research and statistics is not a skill reserved for faculty&#x2015;it is a basic necessity for practitioners who seek to make meaningful contributions to policies, programs, and experiences that matter for students and their learning. This book is a must-read and will transform how you do your work and make decisions." (Patricia A. Perillo, Ph.D., Vice President for Student Affairs and Assistant Professor of Higher Education Virginia Tech, Former president of ACPA&#x2013;College Student Educators International 2017-04-03)<br><br>"Sriram does a masterful job presenting in an accessible manner a topic that many of us in student affairs tend to avoid: quantitative research and statistics. He presents essential, foundational information about research design, data collection, and statistical analysis in a manner that allows the most numbers-averse among us to find value by situating each chapter&#x2019;s discussion in a real-life situation. Readers will be able to recognize themselves in these situations and see how they might use quantitative research techniques to answer their own work-related questions. Both graduate students in student affairs masters programs and full-time student affairs professionals will find great value in this well-written and relatable book." (Robert D.

As the killer stalks her, he also begins a new rampage of kills, and Riley must stop him before it is too late&#x2014;for the other victims, and for herself. But this is no ordinary killer.

Whether in donations to charities such as Save the Children, Oxfam, CARE, UNICEF, or the Red Cross, in the form of enormous loans from the World Bank, or as direct payments from one government to another, the money is earmarked for the needy, for relief in natural disasters floods or famines, earthquakes, or droughts and for assistance in the development of nations.<br><br>The magnitude of generosity from the world&#x2019;s wealthy nations suggests the possibility of easing, if not eliminating, hunger, misery, and poverty; in truth, however, only a small portion of this sixty billion dollars is ever translated into direct assistance. Thanks to bureaucratic inefficiency, misguided policies, large executive salaries, political corruption, and the self-perpetuating overhead&#x201d; of the administrative agencies, much of this tremendous wealth is frittered away, as Graham Hancock&#x2019;s alarming and comprehensive book reveals. Hancock cuts through the smoke screens and hot air of the aristocracy of mercy&#x201d; to provide a critical look at a multinational business that has never been subject to strict accountability.<br><br>Lords of Poverty is a case study in betrayals of a public trust. The shortcomings of aid are numerous, and serious enough to raise questions about the viability of the practice at its most fundamental levels. Hancock&#x2019;s report is thorough, deeply shocking, and certain to cause critical reevaluation of the government&#x2019;s motives in giving foreign aid, and of the true needs of our intended beneficiaries.</p><p></p><h2>We Love Dinosaurs</h2><p><b>"Young readers will thrill to the sight of these smiling, roly-poly, brightly colored dinosaurs." &#x2014; <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>Whether they're big, small, fast, slow, striped, spotted, or anything in between, dinosaurs are just so lovable!

I strive to select projects that offer that &#x201c;mysterious something&#x201d; that gives the book the potential to grow and evolve during the creative process, while I&#x2019;m trying to find the right direction for it. I initiate many of my new book projects by working with my editors, which provides me with more room to stretch ideas. I&#x2019;ve discovered that it doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean more time at my drawing board, but more time for concepts to percolate and take shape. As a result I&#x2019;ve been completing about one book per year.</p> <p><strong>Andrea:</strong> One of the aspects of your books that I love is that they include so much visual storytelling. To me, it seems that you&#x2019;re thinking very carefully about the compositions and characterizations. Do you sketch a lot of rough drafts before starting your paintings?</p> <p><strong>Jerry:</strong> Yes, the number of exploratory drawings seems to grow by great measure with each new project. These early sketches are a way of exploring and searching for a sequence and rhythm. I&#x2019;m also considering the relationship of art to text and how to visually interpret the story. At this stage, composition often evolves. I quite enjoy seeing how many ways I can view a subject or action by turning something inside out. As the drawings develop I think about the characterizations, not necessarily in facial expressions yet, but though body language. When I&#x2019;m satisfied with the right amount of pictures to tell a story, as well as the trim size, I prepare a dummy book .Then I rework and refine these drawings. Recent projects have required two revised dummy books before proceeding to the final art.</p> <p><strong>Andrea:</strong> What&#x2019;s your favorite part of the process of making a new book? Are there some aspects that are easier? Where do the challenges lie?</p> <p><strong>Jerry:</strong> When adapting a project that has been illustrated many times before, I have to find that fresh perspective, a new lens that allows me to take ownership in re-imagining a narrative. For me, this part of the project could best be described as a roller coaster ride, with a pushing and pulling to get me to a place where ideas will gel. This stage can be exhilarating and frustrating. I see what I do as work. If it appears to be easy, I know that I&#x2019;m not reaching deep enough into my imagination pool. However, after I get to the point where the final art satisfies the needs of the text, then it&#x2019;s my time to play, adding more detail here and more contrast there until the painting takes on a life of its own.</p> <p><strong>Andrea:</strong> You have a new book coming out this October, Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, a visual depiction of the classic lullaby. I&#x2019;ve just received a copy, and the book is gorgeous! I guess it would be corny to say that the paintings twinkle, but it&#x2019;s true -- the illustrations seem to illuminate the paper they&#x2019;re printed on. What led to your inspiration for turning this song, which his sung to every child, into a picture book? </p> <p><strong>Jerry:</strong> The idea was presented to me by Andrea Spooner, my editor at Little, Brown. She asked if I would consider creating a bedtime book. She encouraged me to think in terms of an entirely different approach, an original visual narrative--&#x201c;a flight of the imagination&#x201d;--using the lyrics of a lullaby as a kind of &#x201c;soundtrack&#x201d;. I was inspired to stretch my imagination, and so we researched various bedtime stories, songs and poems to consider that are in the public domain. It took exploring and dissecting other classic lullabies before I turned back to Twinkle, Twinkle, and eventually, the song took center stage. With that decision I began to search for the spark that would set my creative juices flowing.</p> <p><strong>Andrea:</strong> In some respects, illustrating a lullaby would seem simple because you can choose to interpret the lyrics any way you wish. It would appear that this freedom is a gift to an artist. At the same time, though, because there&#x2019;s no concrete storyline, a lullaby presents challenges. Can you describe some of the challenges you worked through in creating pictures that express such open-ended lyrics? Also, what were some of the freer aspects?</p> <p><strong>Jerry:</strong> Most narratives have a beginning, middle, and end as well as some sense of place. This wasn&#x2019;t the case with Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. Yet, it was at the top of Andrea Spooner&#x2019;s list because it was so open-ended. It was the lack of being able to rely on a literal interpretation that would become a starting point to revisiting this classic. My &#x201c;a-ha&#x201d; moment came with the line in the refrain, &#x201c;How I wonder what you are.&#x201d; I would attempt to answer that question in my art.</p> <p><strong>Andrea:</strong> Is there a reason you made the main character a chipmunk?</p> <p><strong>Jerry:</strong> I&#x2019;ve been fascinated with chipmunks ever since our family moved to a wooded area in Westchester County. My home and studio look out on stone walls where chipmunks nest. I&#x2019;ve watched as they dart in and out, oftentimes wondering where they were off to in such a purposeful way. What were they in search of? Intrigued and amused, I&#x2019;d often thought about working on a project about my furry neighbors. Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star gave me that opportunity to cast the chipmunk in the lead role. The chipmunk&#x2019;s boundless energy would be interpreted as the curiosity that leads him to search for the little star.</p> <p><strong>Andrea:</strong> Most illustrators conduct research for their books, even when the narrative is whimsical. What resources did you use to help you illustrate the animals and setting for Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star? </p> <p><strong>Jerry:</strong> Research for the chipmunk and supporting characters wasn&#x2019;t difficult. There are a large number of volumes and films in my personal library. Also I made good use of the Croton Free Library and The Tea Town Nature Conservation Center, where I was able to take out a chipmunk mount on loan. No photo can take the place of drawing the real creature. Like the library, the staff at Tea Town was generous with their time in assisting me in getting the wildlife and their environment just right.</p> <p>I rarely use the Internet for research, but in this case it was helpful in providing me ideas for star shapes in nature which could be woven into my intended narrative. For example, the star shape designs of morning glories were used to set into motion the chipmunk&#x2019;s journey. My personal observations also played a major role in the book. Many days standing in the fields behind our home at dusk, I waited and watched for that magical moment when the fireflies would appear. </p> <p><strong>Andrea:</strong> Research aside, your illustrations of animals are often playful -- they exude such joy! Where do you derive the inspiration for bringing such genuine cuteness to your animal paintings?</p> <p><strong>Jerry:</strong> During my frequent walks in the nearby woods I watch wildlife, such as a red fox crossing the road or a deer bounding out of sight. Some days it feels like the animals and I are communicating for a brief moment, and there&#x2019;s an overwhelming sense of being at one with nature. These moments serve as my inspiration. In my works where the animal is a stand-in for a human, it&#x2019;s about striking the balance between the natural beauty of a creature, and my need to personify the animal to fit the narrative.</p> <p><strong>Andrea:</strong> Jerry, so many of us are still thrilled about the success of your Caldecott-winning picture book The Lion and the Mouse. I&#x2019;ve always thought of you as my &#x201c;Daddy Lion&#x201d; -- you&#x2019;re a mighty great man, and the book just proves that you&#x2019;re a mighty great artist. In The Lion and the Mouse, you rely on art more than text to tell the story. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this kind of storytelling?</p> <p><strong>Jerry:</strong> Because The Lion and the Mouse did not begin as a wordless picture book, I was blind to its challenges. My intent was to develop a visual storyboard for the fable. Then I planned to add text once I was satisfied with my sketches. It was only after working on thumbnails that I began asking myself, &#x201c;Isa text going to enhance the narrative, or just be redundant?&#x201d; The pictures seemed to find their own voice; that&#x2019;s when my creative process is at its best. So I didn&#x2019;t really have to consider the advantages and disadvantages of doing it one way or the other. For me, it&#x2019;s all about discovery, following notions, and letting them be my guide.</p> <p><strong>Andrea:</strong> This has been quite an amazing time for you! You&#x2019;ve won the Caldecott Medal, which was a very sweet cherry on top of a cake that already includes five Caldecott Honor medals, five Coretta Scott King Awards, and four Coretta Scott King Honor medals. And, you were recently inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame. Wow, Daddy Lion, that quite a list of accolades! What&#x2019;s next for you?</p> <p><strong>Jerry:</strong> My mind is always at work revisiting childhood stories and memories to see if there is something to jump-start a new project. Right now I&#x2019;m working on two new projects which I&#x2019;m adapting. As long as subjects inspire me and as long as I&#x2019;m curious, there will be stories for me to reinterpret. Here in my studio there are plenty of blank sheets of paper and sketchpads waiting to be filled.</p> <p><strong>Andrea:</strong> Well, that&#x2019;s certainly enough to keep your plate full.

Yet few realize what richness, depth, truth, and connection are packed into this sacred phrase.</p><p>Throughout the centuries, Christian tradition has taught us to end prayers with <em>amen</em>. But the Bible is full of stories and passages where God&#x2019;s people <em>started</em> their prayers with <em>amen</em>. Why? As Beth Guckenberger shows, <em>amen</em> is more than just a way to punctuate a conversation with the God of the Universe. <em>Amen</em> is a declaration of who God is and who we are in relation to him. It is a moment of submission and worship, saying &#x201c;So be it&#x201d; to a Sovereignty that holds all things, and acknowledging &#x201c;It is as you say&#x201d; to him who holds our lives.</p><p>In <em>Amen</em>, Beth unpacks all the Bible has to teach us about the moment we say <em>amen</em> to God. Using key scripture passages mixed with fresh teaching and personal stories, she invites readers to experience the richness they&#x2019;ve been missing.</p><p><em>Amen</em> is more than just a word. <em>Amen</em> is a full invitation from God packed with all that he requires from us and all he longs to bestow upon us as his beloved children. As Beth writes, &#x201c;He is beckoning us all. Come to me. Learn my ways. You are my child, whom I dearly love and bought with a price. The God of Amen rescued you so you can echo <em>amen</em> back to him. God intended this word to be a moment of intimacy, drenched in reverence, replete with peace&#x2014;the moment when you rest in him and are rejuvenated by him. There is so much more he wants to give. Amen.&#x201d;</p><p>If Christians long to be truly connected to their Creator, they must begin with <em>amen</em>. For, as Isaiah 65:16 says, &#x201c;Because he who is blessed in the earth will be blessed by the God of Amen.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Beth Guckenberger and her husband, Todd, live with their family in Cincinnati, Ohio, where they serve as co-executive directors of Back2Back Ministries.

And now they have finally reached the breaking point. Ben and his friends excitedly rush out of their classroom to bear witness, and follow the throngs of redcoats marching out of Boston toward Concord. Much to Ben&#x2019;s surprise, Boston is sealed off later that day&#x2014;leaving the boys stuck outside the city, in the middle of a war, with no way to reach their families. But Ben isn&#x2019;t worried&#x2014;he&#x2019;s eager to help the Patriots! He soon becomes a clerk to the jovial Israel Putnam, a general in the provincial army. For months he watches the militia grow into an organized army, and when the Battle of Bunker Hill erupts, Ben is awed by the bravery of the Patriots, although saddened by the toll war takes.

She lives in Kansas City.CHAPTER 1<br><b>Defeat</b><br>The line outside Madison Square Garden started to form at 5:30 p.m., just as an orange autumn sun was setting in New York City on Halloween Eve, 1912. The doors were not scheduled to open for another hour and a half, but the excitement surrounding the Progressive Party's last major rally of the presidential campaign promised a packed house. The party was still in its infancy, fighting for a foothold in its first national election, but it had something that the Democrats had never had and the Republicans had lately lost, the star attraction that drew tens of thousands of people to the Garden that night: Theodore Roosevelt.<br><br>Roosevelt, one of the most popular presidents in his nation's history, had vowed never to run again after winning his second term in the White House in 1904. But now, just eight years later, he was not only running for a third term, he was, to the horror and outrage of his old Republican backers, running as a third-party candidate against Democrats and Republicans alike.<br><br>Roosevelt's decision to abandon the Republican Party and run as a Progressive had been bitterly criticized, not just because he was muddying the political waters but because he still had a large and almost fanatically loyal following. Roosevelt was five feet eight inches tall, about average height for an American man in the early twentieth century, weighed more than two hundred pounds, and had a voice that sounded as if he had just taken a sip of helium, but his outsized personality made him unforgettable--and utterly irresistible. He delighted in leaning over the podium as though he were about to snatch his audience up by its collective collar; he talked fast, pounded his fists, waved his arms, and sent a current of electricity through the crowd. "Such unbounded energy and vitality impressed one like the perennial forces of nature," the naturalist John Burroughs once wrote of Roosevelt. "When he came into the room it was as if a strong wind had blown the door open."<br><br>Not surprisingly, Roosevelt was proving to be dangerous competition for the Democratic candidate, Woodrow Wilson, to say nothing of President William Howard Taft, the lackluster Republican incumbent whom Roosevelt had hand-picked to be his successor in the White House four years earlier. It was a bitterly contested race, and Roosevelt hoped that this rally, strategically scheduled just a week before election day, could help swing the vote in his favor.<br><br>Before the doors even opened, more than a hundred thousand people were swarming the sidewalks and choking the surrounding cobblestone streets. Men and boys nimbly wove their way through the crowd, boldly hawking tickets in plain sight of a hundred uniformed policemen. The scalpers had their work cut out for them selling tickets in the churning throng. Days earlier the Progressive Party, nicknamed the Bull Moose Party in honor of its tenacious leader, had posted a no more tickets sign, but brokers and street-corner salesmen had continued to do a brisk business. Dollar seats went for as much as seven dollars--roughly $130 in today's money--and the priciest tickets in the house could set the buyer back as much as a hundred dollars. On the chaotic black market, however, even experienced con men could not be sure what they had actually bought. When Vincent Astor, son of financier John Jacob Astor, arrived at his box, he found it already occupied by George Graham Rice, lately of Blackswell's Island--then one of New York's grimmest penitentiaries. When the police escorted him out, Rice complained bitterly that he had paid ten dollars for the two choice seats. <br><br>More than two thousand people tried to make it into the arena by bypassing the line and driving to the gate in a hired carriage or one of Henry Ford's open-air Model T's. But this tactic did not work for everyone. Even Roosevelt's own sister Corinne was turned away at the gate.<br><br>"For some unexplained reason the pass which had been given to me that night for my motor was not accepted by the policeman in charge, and I, my husband, my son Monroe, and our friend Mrs. Parsons were obliged to take our places in the cheering, laughing, singing crowd," she later wrote. "How it swayed and swung! how it throbbed with life and elation! how imbued it was with an earnest party ambition, and yet, with a deep and genuine religious fervor. Had I lived my whole life only for those fifteen minutes during which I marched toward the Garden already full to overflowing with my brother's adoring followers, I should have been content to do so." Caught up in the moment, fifty-one-year-old Corinne finally made it into the arena by climbing a fire escape.<br><br>Theodore Roosevelt, the object of all the furor, had nearly as much trouble trying to reach Madison Square Garden as his sister. The police had blocked off Twenty-seventh Street from Madison to Fourth Avenue for his car, but when his black limousine turned onto Madison Avenue at nine-fifteen, the excitement burning all night flamed into hysteria. A <i>New York Sun </i>reporter marveled at the chaos as swarms of people rushed Roosevelt's car, "yelling their immortal souls out. They went through a battery of photographers, tried to sweep the cops off their feet, tangled, jammed and shoved into the throng."<br><br>Roosevelt, a little stiff in his black suit, stepped out of the car, raised his hat to the crowd, and walked through a narrow, bucking pathway that the policemen had opened through the suffocating press of bodies. As Roosevelt passed by, his admirers "had their brief and delirious howls, their cries of greeting," one reporter wrote. When he opened a door that led directly onto the speaker's platform, the arena seemed to expand with his very presence, and the people outside "had to step back and watch the walls of the big building ripple under the vocal pressure from within, like the accordion-pleated skirt of a dancer."<br>Inside the auditorium, Edith Roosevelt, every inch the aristocrat with her softly cleft chin and long, elegant neck, was seated in a box above the fray when a mighty roar rose up from the audience, heralding her husband's entrance. Four colossal American flags greeted Roosevelt, waving grandly from the girdered ceiling, and an entire, massive bull moose stood mounted on a pedestal and bathed in a white spotlight, its head raised high, its ears erect, as if about to charge.<br><br>Roosevelt, still famously energetic at fifty-four, greeted his admirers with characteristic vigor, pumping his left arm in the air like a windmill. His right arm, however, hung motionless at his side. The last time Roosevelt had given a speech--just two weeks earlier, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin--he had been shot in the chest by a thirty-six-year-old New York bartender named John Schrank, a Bavarian immigrant who feared that Roosevelt's run for a third term was an effort to establish a monarchy in the United States. Incredibly, Roosevelt's heavy army overcoat and the folded fifty-page manuscript and steel spectacle-case he carried in his right breast pocket had saved his life, but the bullet had plunged some five inches deep, lodging near his rib cage. That night, whether out of an earnest desire to deliver his message or merely an egotist's love of drama, Roosevelt had insisted on delivering his speech to a terrified and transfixed audience. His coat unbuttoned to reveal a bloodstained shirt, and his speech held high so that all could see the two sinister-looking holes made by the assailant's bullet, Roosevelt had shouted, "It takes more than that to kill a bull moose!"<br><br>Now, in Madison Square Garden as the boisterous cheering went on for forty-one minutes, Roosevelt still had one of Schrank's bullets in his chest. At 10:03 p.m., pounding on the flag-draped desk in front of him and nervously snapping his jaws, he finally convinced the crowd that he was in earnest, and the hall slowly quieted. Unaided by a loudspeaker, an invention that would revolutionize public speaking the following year, he began his speech. "Friends . . ." At the sound of his voice, the crowd erupted into a thunderous cheer that continued for two more minutes. When it tapered off, he began again. "My friends," he said, "perhaps once in a generation . . ." Suddenly, from seats close to the platform, a clamor arose as policemen tried to push back several people who had forced their way into the hall. Bending forward, Roosevelt bellowed, "Keep those people quiet, please! Officers, be quiet!"<br><br>Then, in a voice that filled the auditorium, Theodore Roosevelt launched into the last great campaign speech of his political career: "Friends, perhaps once in a generation, perhaps not so often, there comes a chance for the people of a country to play their part wisely and fearlessly in some great battle of the age-long warfare for human rights." He still had the old percussive rhythm, exploding his "p"s and "b"s with vigor, but his tone had lost the violence and his words the bitterness of the past. He did not attack his opponents--the coolly academic Wilson or the genial Taft. Instead, he talked in broad terms about character, moral strength, compassion, and responsibility. "We do not set greed against greed or hatred against hatred," he thundered. "Our creed is one that bids us to be just to all, to feel sympathy for all, and to strive for an understanding of the needs of all. Our purpose is to smite down wrong."<br><br>To the people in the hall, and to millions of Americans, Roosevelt was a hero, a leader, an icon. But even as he stood on the stage at Madison Square Garden, he knew that in six days he would lose not only the election but also this bright, unblinking spotlight. He would be reviled by many and then ignored by all, and that would be the worst death he could imagine.<br><br>"I know the American people," he had said prophetically in 1910, upon returning to a hero's welcome after an epic journey to Africa. "They have a way of erecting a triumphal arch, and after the Conquering Hero has passed beneath it he may expect to receive a shower of bricks on his back at any moment."<br>On election day, November 5, 1912, Roosevelt's grim expectations about his candidacy were realized in full. Woodrow Wilson took the White House in a landslide victory, winning 2.2 million more votes than Roosevelt out of the fifteen million cast. Roosevelt did not lose alone, however. He brought Taft, the incumbent Republican president, down with him. Only three and a half million Americans had voted for Taft, some six hundred thousand fewer than voted for Roosevelt and nearly three million fewer than Wilson. The Socialist candidate, Eugene V. Debs, pulled in over nine hundred thousand votes, more than twice the number he had received during his presidential run four years earlier.<br><br>For Roosevelt, who was not used to losing, even his victory over Taft was cold comfort. He had long ago lost his respect for the three-hundred-pound president, dismissing him as "a flubdub with a streak of the second-rate and the common in him." Besides, everyone knew that Taft hadn't really been in the race from the beginning. Before the Republican convention, even Taft's own wife, the fiercely ambitious Nellie, had told him, "I suppose you will have to fight Mr. Roosevelt for the nomination, and if you get it he will defeat you."<br><br>She was right on both counts. Roosevelt had at first vied for the Republican nomination, and when party bosses ensured Taft's victory, he had struck back by ensuring their defeat in the general election. As a third-party candidate, Roosevelt could not count on winning, but he could certainly spoil. When backed by a united Republican Party in his earlier election bids, Roosevelt had swept easily to victory over the Democrats. By turning his enormous popularity against his former party, however, he merely split the Republican vote and handed the election to Wilson--a widely predicted result that, when it came to pass, provoked bitter criticism of his tactics. "Roosevelt goes down to personal and richly deserved defeat," spat an editorial in the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>. "But he has the satisfaction of knowing that by giving vent to his insatiate ambition and deplorable greed for power he has elevated the democratic party to the control of the nation."<br><br>Roosevelt had never been willing to share his private pain with the public. In a formal statement, he announced, "I accept the result with entire good humor and contentment." In private, however, he admitted to being surprised and shaken by the scope of his crushing defeat. "There is no use disguising the fact that the defeat at the polls is overwhelming," he wrote to his friend the British military attache Arthur Hamilton Lee. "I had expected defeat, but I had expected that we would make a better showing. . . . I try not to think of the damage to myself personally."<br><br>The Republican Party's Old Guard, once a bastion of Roosevelt's friends and backers, held him responsible for the debacle that had put a Democrat in the White House for the first time in sixteen years. Before the Republican convention, they had assured Roosevelt that if he would only accept the party's decision to let Taft run for a second term in 1912, they would happily hand him the nomination four years later. But his injured pride and his passion for what he believed to be a battle against the nation's great injustices had driven him out of the fold. "Many of his critics could account for his leaving the Republican Party and heading another, only on the theory that he was moved by a desire for revenge," William Roscoe Thayer, Roosevelt's friend and one of his earliest biographers, wrote in 1919. "If he could not rule he would ruin. The old allegation that he must be crazy was of course revived."<br>Roosevelt spent that winter hunkered down at Sagamore Hill with his wife and their younger daughter, Ethel. He took walks with Edith, answered letters, and worked quietly in his book-lined study. He had few interruptions.<br><br>"The telephone, which had rung like sleigh-bells all day and half the night, was silent," wrote Roosevelt's young literary friend and eventual biographer Hermann Hagedorn. "The North Shore neighbors who, in the old days, had flocked to Sagamore at every opportunity, on horseback or in their high fancy traps, did not drive their new shining motor-cars up the new, hard-surfaced road the Roosevelts had put in the year before. The Colonel was outside the pale. He had done the unforgivable thing--he had 'turned against his class.' "<br><br>Friends and colleagues who had once competed for Roosevelt's attention now shunned him. Roosevelt, like his wife, had been born into New York's highest society. From childhood, he had been not only accepted but admired and undoubtedly envied as a Roosevelt, the older son of a wealthy and respected man. As an undergraduate at Harvard, he had been a member of the exclusive and unapologetically elitist Porcellian Club. During the Spanish-American War, he had been glorified as a courageous colonel of his own regiment--Roosevelt's Rough Riders. And as president of the United States for nearly eight years, he had been at the apex of power and prestige. Now, for the first time in his life, he was a pariah, and he was painfully aware of it.</p><h2>Perfumes, Splashes &amp; Colognes: Discovering and Crafting Your Personal Fragrances</h2><p>Discover the joys of crafting your own unique and personal perfumes.

For open minds, it may begin a whole new awakening as to our understanding of who we are, where we came from, and a very profound and powerful re-connection to our common Theocosmology, that has been occulted from most for over 500 years. How can it be that for over 5,000 years, as far back as modern history allows us, that nearly every single culture on Earth believed the land we all have lived upon since our birth was known to be mostly flat, motionless and the center of just one creation we call a uni-verse, just one of many verses, of many creations? Nearly all ancient cultures previous to the current Roman Dynasty (310 AD &#x2013; present) held Flat Earth Theocosmological belief systems. I am not just speaking about one or two civilizations of our common past, but the cultures of most civilizations covering thousands of years, across all lands and races. From the Ancient Chinese, with their Ying/Yang symbolism of the dance of the Sun and Moon in circle above, to the Indian Vedic&#x2019;s, Buddhists, Sumerians, Chaldeans, Babylonians, Egyptians, Ancient Hebrews, Greeks and Nordic Vikings. All had geocentric Flat Earth theocosmology. That all stars, the Sun and the Moon, were centered around our Earth signified the cosmic importance of humans in the really big picture of our universal make up. That Earth was the center for all of this creation. The word &#x201c;world&#x201d; comes from the energy vortex created by the electromagnetic battery of our Flat Earth connected through the North Pole and Antarctic Circles positive and negative charges. The salt in the ocean providing the electrolyte catalyst to charge Earth&#x2019;s plasma battery field. We all are contained in a plasma toroidal field of perpetual regeneration inside a closed system energy vortex which causes a &#x201c;whirling&#x201d; action, hence the word whirled or world. We call it a sunrise and sunset, yet, according to the most basic of heliocentric theory, this is a grossly incorrect term, that has never been corrected for over 100 years from academia to the science community. Why? One possible reason was when heliocentrism was introduced to the public education systems of Western world, most worked and lived outdoors. Even peasants knew the Earth was still and the Sun was moving and if anyone tried to sell them that the Sun was not moving would have been met with complete disbelief and derided for sheer stupidity and the ruling governance would lose instant credibility. So what would be the correct terms for a Flat Earth movement of the Sun instead of &#x201c;Sunrise&#x201d; and &#x201c;Sunset&#x201d;? For over the past 100 years, most world education systems continue to this day to teach little-to-none of Flat Earth history and cosmology connecting to this rich history of all our common pasts. Why would they not want us to know a narrative of our existence where the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars were placed in the sky above to help guide and assist us in our own evolution of consciousness? What would anyone gain by creating a myth so that we would feel insignificant, small and just one of billions and billions and billions of other planets, stars and life? If you were in power, would you want the minions one day to take over your power base that has been created over hundreds, if not thousands of years. The powers in charge of world propaganda, monetary policy, religion and infotainment wish to keep us fully disempowered as to our highest potential of humanities, and our own, evolutions. From Copernicus, all the way to the creation of the Big Bang Theory by Jesuit priest, Father Gorge Lemaitre, the Vatican and the Society of Jesus have had, and still to this day, have large influence in all things Astronomy and space observation.

One side sought to own the riches of North America and the other struggled to hold on to traditional homelands and ways of life. The book reveals how the ideas of honor, fair dealings, good faith, rule of law, and peaceful relations between nations have been tested and challenged in historical and modern times. The book consistently demonstrates how and why centuries-old treaties remain living, relevant documents for both Natives and non-Natives in the 21st century.</p><p>SUZAN SHOWN HARJO (Cheyenne/Hodulgee Muscogee) is an advocate for American Indian rights as well as a poet, writer, lecturer, and curator. She is president of the Morning Star Institute, an American Indian rights advocacy group in Washington, DC.<b>BOOKLIST<br></b><p>This seminal volume, being published in conjunction with an exhibition at the Smithsonian&#x2019;s National Museum of the American Indian, also commemorates the museum&#x2019;s tenth anniversary. Those who contributed essays include Native and non-Native historians, legal scholars, and tribal activists, their sources culled from Native American material culture, tribal oral traditions, interviews, and historical documents. In assessing &#x201c;what went wrong&#x201d; with the 368 treaty relationships of &#x201c;mutual respect&#x201d; forged between 1777 and 1868, the authors cite numerous overreaches of power by the U.S. government, including the Doctrine of Discovery of 1823, whereby Indians lost the title to their lands, only retaining the right to occupy them; the &#x201c;civilization regulations&#x201d; which, beginning in 1883, criminalized everything traditional in Indian life; and the Plenary Power Doctrine of 1903, which stated that Congress could abrogate treaties without tribal consent. As the twentieth century unfolded, Indian nations &#x201c;dusted off their treaties&#x201d; and demanded that their original bilateral intent be fulfilled&#x2014;leading to the restoration of water rights, fishing rights, and tribal civil jurisdiction. This landmark volume highlights this crucial and evolving process.&nbsp; <i>&#x2014; Deborah Donovan</i></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><b>MUSEUM ANTHROPOLOGY</b></p><p>This impressive volume is lavishly illustrated with rare historical and stunning contemporary images and is about much more than just treaties.

Linking multiculturalism to a distinctive political and religious context, the book argues that welfare-state democracy, unlike bourgeois liberalism, has rejected the once conventional distinction between government and civil society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gottfried argues that the West&#x2019;s relentless celebrations of diversity have resulted in the downgrading of the once dominant Western culture. The moral rationale of government has become the consciousness-raising of a presumed majority population. While welfare states continue to provide entitlements and fulfill the other material programs of older welfare regimes, they have ceased to make qualitative leaps in the direction of social democracy. For the new political elite, nationalization and income redistributions have become less significant than controlling the speech and thought of democratic citizens. An escalating hostility toward the bourgeois Christian past, explicit or at least implicit in the policies undertaken by the West and urged by the media, is characteristic of what Gottfried labels an emerging &#x201c;therapeutic&#x201d; state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Gottfried, acceptance of an intrusive political correctness has transformed the religious consciousness of Western, particularly Protestant, society. The casting of &#x201c;true&#x201d; Christianity as a religion of sensitivity only toward victims has created a precondition for extensive social engineering. Gottfried examines late-twentieth-century liberal Christianity as the promoter of the politics of guilt. Metaphysical guilt has been transformed into self-abasement in relation to the &#x201c;suffering just&#x201d; identified with racial, cultural, and lifestyle minorities. Unlike earlier proponents of religious liberalism, the therapeutic statists oppose anything, including empirical knowledge, that impedes the expression of social and cultural guilt in an effort to raise the self-esteem of designated victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equally troubling to Gottfried is the growth of an American empire that is influencing European values and fashions. Europeans have begun, he says, to embrace the multicultural movement that originated with American liberal Protestantism&#x2019;s emphasis on diversity as essential for democracy. He sees Europeans bringing authoritarian zeal to enforcing ideas and behavior imported from the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Multiculturalism and the Politics of Guilt</i> extends the arguments of the author&#x2019;s earlier <i>After Liberalism</i>. Whether one challenges or supports Gottfried&#x2019;s conclusions, all will profit from a careful reading of this latest diagnosis of the American condition.</p><p>Paul Edward Gottfried is Professor of Humanities at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania. He is the author of <i>After Liberalism: Mass Democracy in the Managerial State</i> and <i>The Search for Historical Meaning: Hegel and the Postwar American Right</i>.<p>"It is a small, conservative, philosophical gem, and I love it."--<b>Amos Perlmutter</b></p><br><br><p>"Gottfried's book addresses multicultural ideology and its program: to fashion beliefs and behavior in conformity with the multicultural outlook on the world, which is one of victim and victimizer. . . . His analysis of the situation both in the United States and in western Europe is devastating and brilliant, and in providing a precise analysis of what it is we are up against he has produced a book from which any authentic conservative would benefit."--<b><i>American Conservative</i></b></p><br><br><p>"Gottfried has seen an aspect of multiculturalism and political correctness that previous critics of these doctrines have failed adequately to stress. He uses his insight to develop a brilliant analysis and critique of the modern managerial and therapeutic state. . . . Gottfried has dissected the social effects of the contemporary church better than anyone else of whom I am aware."--<b><i>Mises Review</i></b></p><br><br><p>For those who can handle the truth, Paul Edward Gottfried serves as a fusion of Aristotle, Joseph de Maistre, and Carl Schmitt. What Aristotle did for the Greek polis, Gottfried has done for the nation-states of the West. . . .

Yet it seems obvious that, try as we might, our lives are not quite what we fantasize. Is the intuition thus wrong? Through a rational, methodic interpretation of meditative insights, the validity of which is substantiated with a compelling scientific literature review, the author constructs hypotheses that reconcile facts with intuition. Mesmerizing narratives of his expeditions into the unconscious suggest an amazing possibility: just as dreams are seemingly autonomous manifestations of our psyche, reality may be an externalized combination of the subconscious dreams of us all, mixed as they are projected onto the fabric of space-time. Perhaps the laws of physics are an emergent by-product of such synchronization of thoughts. Through computer simulations, the author explores the implications of these hypotheses, with conclusions uncannily reminiscent of observed phenomena.</p><p>Bernardo Kastrup has a Ph.D. in philosophy and another in computer engineering.

They&#x2019;re always showing off. They&#x2019;re not so sure of themselves when they&#x2019;re alone. But in the posse&#x2014;giddyup.<br><br>It&#x2019;s hopeless. I can&#x2019;t keep up. I&#x2019;m always one Marc Jacobs, one Juicy Couture behind.<br><br>There&#x2019;s Julie.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi hi.&#x201d; Kiss kiss.<br><br>She hates my guts. Look at her cruising my once-something-now-so-over boot. I wish my feet were leaves. Blow away. I bought the brown leather riding boots like you said. Even though I&#x2019;m allergic to horses and I didn&#x2019;t have the money. Or I should say my mother didn&#x2019;t. She&#x2019;s a temp secretary and sometimes for weeks doesn&#x2019;t even get called. I got hysterical in the shoe store. Started hyperventilating on the floor. My mother was so embarrassed that she paid.<br><br>But then they changed right after that. Julie says riding boots are so pre-Britney. It&#x2019;s all about purple UGGs. My mother will not even consider it. She doesn&#x2019;t get it. She constantly jeopardizes my position. I mean she&#x2019;s the reason I can&#x2019;t keep up. I hate my mother and I hate these painful riding boots even more. To be honest I didn&#x2019;t like them in the first place. Now I just look like a stupid girl without a pony.<br><br>Oh God, Julie just can&#x2019;t stop.<br><br>&#x201c;Cut it out, okay? I got the drop circle earrings like you said and the . . . Just stop checking me out.&#x201d;<br><br>Don&#x2019;t worry. I don&#x2019;t say this out loud. Only in my head. They are my friends . . . supposedly.<br><br>Julie now hates every bit of me. It happened yesterday. I completely blew it. I was accidentally nice to Wendy Apple in front of them. I forgot and hugged her right there. I lost myself. Wendy is so out. She&#x2019;s got wild hair and her family lives in this ugly house and she has the dumbest laugh. She can&#x2019;t help herself and she really doesn&#x2019;t care. To be honest, I sort of like Wendy. Well, I admire her. She&#x2019;s pretty sarcastic and draws these amazing pictures of slutty angels who are always falling from somewhere like outer space. But it&#x2019;s familiar.<br><br>Julie says she&#x2019;s not like us. Well, them. Julie saw me hug Wendy and did the big eyeball roll in front of all of the posse like I was demented or pathetic and then she turned her back on me. So did they. Like her backup dancers.<br><br>So I got mad at Wendy. I shoved her a little and turned my head and told Wendy to stay away from me. She just looked at me, stared in shock like I was an alien. Then she started crying. That made me feel pretty shitty because I kind of like her a lot. But it made Julie like me again. Later Julie gave me the same kind of glitter lipstick that Beyonc� wore at the MTV music awards. Julie only used it for two weeks.<br><br>But she is suspicious. So are the others. The word is out. It&#x2019;s because of my clunky boots and my tits. Well, my lack of them. Julie is stacked and that&#x2019;s why all the greatest guys are after her. She and Bree rule the posse. They don&#x2019;t go anywhere apart. Even to pee. I saw them go into the toilet together. They were laughing real loud and we were all wondering if it was us they were laughing at. Wendy told me they had padded bras and went all the way. That&#x2019;s why the guys like them so much. But Julie is genuinely pretty and very skinny. Her stomach is totally wholly abbed and flat like Gwen Stefani&#x2019;s and she&#x2019;s got that &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help it if I&#x2019;m perfect&#x201d; smile. Bree&#x2019;s hair is actually a little frizzy but she&#x2019;s got perfect breasts and the coolest voice all deep like Miley and she doesn&#x2019;t even have to fake it. She was born like that. Bree brought me into the posse &#x2019;cause I helped her with her history exam. She definitely regrets it now. I am the contaminator. Loser-girl virus. It spreads so fast, and once you get it you&#x2019;re forever dead and ugly.<br><br>Oh God. Look at them. They can&#x2019;t even go to the vending machine without each other. Aren&#x2019;t they happy?<br><br>I shouldn&#x2019;t be telling you this. Breaking confidentiality. Totally illegal. We signed this posse agreement, really cool like<br><br>Angelina Jolie&#x2019;s personal assistants do.<br><br>But sometimes I want to say:<br><br>&#x201c;Grow up. Be real. Stop pretending. Leave me alone.&#x201d;<br><br>Don&#x2019;t worry, I don&#x2019;t say this out loud. Only in my head. These are my friends . . . supposedly.<br><br>But the reason they hate Wendy Apple so much is &#x2019;cause she was one of them once. Higher up than Bree. I mean, she could have been a Julie. What Wendy did was like a revolutionary. She just gave it up. I mean, she walked away. She said it was stupid. And she told everyone their secrets. Even the ugliest and fattest girls know about their padded bras. Julie and Bree tried to sue. But the posse agreement didn&#x2019;t really hold up in high school court.<br><br>I can&#x2019;t believe it. Julie and Bree are all over Amber. That&#x2019;s because of Amber&#x2019;s older brother who Julie is suddenly dating. Amber made this happen, and so now Julie is just worshipping her. I mean, God, you would think Amber would be embarrassed. Two weeks ago Julie and Bree humiliated her in the locker room, did the posse circle in the shower when Amber was naked and we all laughed at her body.<br><br>You know Wendy wrote me a note in third period and said she wasn&#x2019;t crying for herself. She said she was crying for me &#x2019;cause I started out so nice and now I am so desperate. But I&#x2019;m not funny like Wendy or talented. I am so tragically in the middle. Not one outstanding characteristic. I have nothing going for me . . . but them.<br><br>Wait a minute. There&#x2019;s no more room at the table. Tiffany was supposed to get there first and save me a seat. But Tiffany is sitting in between Julie and Bree.<br><br>Oh God, look at my boots&#x2014;?they are so stupid. And my hair, I hate it. My mother can&#x2019;t even get work as a typist. I&#x2019;m just a pathetic blob of middle girl.<br><br>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t do this. Make room at the table. Tiffany, what about my seat? Don&#x2019;t squeeze me out. Tiffany, stop pretending I&#x2019;m not here. Oh look, look. Julie is braiding your hair. So now you&#x2019;re Julie&#x2019;s friend. Tiffany! Tiffany, turn around! I am here. I am not dead. What? What?&#x201d;<br><br>Bree is motioning them to cut me off. They&#x2019;re giving me the posse slam.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that. Bree, remember I helped you pass the exam? I gave you the answers and risked my ass. Listen. I don&#x2019;t like these riding boots. I bought them for you. I know you were really generous to let me in because I am so utterly insignificant. I know I don&#x2019;t have breasts. I&#x2019;ll get the UGGs. I promise. I won&#x2019;t be nice to people you hate. I&#x2019;ll do whatever you want. Please. Please just let me sit down. Make room on the bench. Let me in. Let me in. Let me in!!&#x201d;<br><br>Oh God. Everyone is looking. I must be really screaming. It&#x2019;s in the cafeteria and not just in my head.<br><br>&#x201c;Let me in. Make room on the bench.&#x201d;<br><br>(Tantrum)<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do it, Julie. I can&#x2019;t keep up. I will never be invited. I won&#x2019;t ever get the guy. My hair is stringy and ugly and my breasts don&#x2019;t exist. I am a piece of shit shit shit. Let me in. Let me in.&#x201d;<br><br>(She collapses.)<br><br>(She wakes up.)<br><br>I wake up at Wendy&#x2019;s. There is incense burning that smells like fruit. Apples, I think. Right. Wendy Apple. I don&#x2019;t remember how I got here. Wendy is sitting next to the bed, drawing a picture of me as an angel in transition. She says I have hit bottom. And that it feels terrible now. But I am lucky it has happened so young. She says she will be my friend if I can stop worrying about being popular. She says there are others who don&#x2019;t fit in and I will like them better. She says there is another world and the door is open. She says she can help.<br><br>Wendy laughs and it&#x2019;s too loud. I want to be pretty. Wendy is incredibly kind. I want to be skinny. Wendy is on the outside. And I am no one. Wendy is by my bed and she is drawing my picture.<br><br>WHAT DON&#x2019;T YOU LIKE ABOUT BEING A GIRL?<br><br>Girls can&#x2019;t control anything<br><br>Boys can do anything they want<br><br>My brother is adored,<br><br>I am ignored<br><br>My boobs, people talking about my boobs<br><br>People assuming you can&#x2019;t do something<br><br>My boobs, it all changed with my boobs<br><br>Blood, cramps, seven days<br><br>People thinking you are weak<br><br>A girl can get pregnant<br><br>You have to do your hair<br><br>You have to remove your hair<br><br>Wash and iron clothes<br><br>More chance of being raped<br><br>Have to take care of husbands and kids<br><br>Girls can&#x2019;t work even though<br><br>they are educated.</p><h2>For All the Saints: Remembering the Christian Departed</h2><p><p>"We have been drifting into a muddle and a mess, putting together bits and pieces of traditions, ideas and practices in the hope that they will make sense. They don't. There may be times when a typical Anglican fudge is a pleasant, chewy sort of thing, but this isn't one of them. It's time to think and speak clearly and act decisively." </p> <p>With these robust words Tom Wright, Bishop of Durham, throws down a challenge to current liturgy and practice surrounding All Saints' and All Souls' Days, and sets out to clarify our thinking about what happens to people after they die. Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory, what it means to pray for the dead, what (and who) are the saints, are all addressed in this invigorating and rigorously argued book.</p></p><p>N. T. (Tom) Wright is the Bishop of Durham in the Church of England. He is a prolific author and noted New Testament scholar. He has written more than thirty books, both at the scholarly level (including Jesus and the Victory of God, The Resurrection of the Son of God, and The Meaning of Jesus) and for a popular audience (including Simply Christian, The Meal Jesus Gave Us (WJK), and Who Was Jesus?).&#34;In challenging the existence of an eternal soul and questioning the traditional view of Heaven, Dr. Wright is taking a more biblical approach than most of his more liberal contemporaries. More often it has been the liberalism of Bishops of Durham that shocked the establishment.&#34;</p><h2>Ten Girls Who Made a Difference (Lightkeepers)</h2><p><p>Would you like to make a difference?

Meanwhile, in an alternative or perhaps future universe, a team of superheroes ponder modern society during their time off. Between black-ops missions and rescuing hostages, they swap stories of artistic malaise and muse on the seemingly inescapable grip of market economics. </p><p>Gleefully toying with the conventions of the novel, <i>Dear Cyborgs </i>weaves together the story of a friendship&#x2019;s dissolution with a provocative and timely meditation on protest. Through a series of linked monologues, a lively cast of characters explores narratives of resistance&#x2015;protest art, eco-terrorists, Occupy squatters, pyromaniacal militants&#x2015;and the extent to which any of these can truly withstand and influence the cold demands of contemporary capitalism. All the while, a mysterious cybernetic book of clairvoyance beckons, and trusted allies start to disappear.</p><p>Entwining comic-book villains with cultural critiques, Eugene Lim&#x2019;s <i>Dear Cyborgs </i>is a fleet-footed literary exploration of power, friendship, and creativity.

It&#x2019;s surprising, and&#x2015;while giving despair its full measure&#x2015;it&#x2019;s surprisingly inspiring. A Bolano-esque labyrinth of shaggy dog stories flow through the narrator, describing the existential and physical conditions of a present in which <i>it&#x2019;s easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism, </i>but it&#x2019;s written in calm and succinct, elegant prose. Lim nails the amnesia of sensory overload perfectly." &#x2015;Chris Kraus, <i>BOMB</i></p><p>"Wondrous . . . [Lim's] writing is confident and tranquil; he has a knack for making everyday life seem strange&#x2015;or, in the case of <i>Dear Cyborgs</i>, for making revolution seem like the most natural thing possible. His writing is transfixing from page to page, filled with digressive meditations on small talk and social protest, superheroes, terrorism, the art world, and the status of being marginal . . . There&#x2019;s an intoxicating, whimsical energy on every page. Everything from radical art to political protest gets absorbed into the rhythms of everyday life . . .

In structure it resembles the great mid-century metafictions . . . Eugene Lim&#x2019;s super-comrades, with their cultural disaffection and nuanced political opinions, offer a rather more compelling version of a collective consciousness." &#x2015;David Hobbs, <i>Times Literary Supplement </i></p><p>"Lim's third novel might be the most delightful read you'll find all summer . . . Through seamlessly incorporated meditations on political protest and radical art, <i>Dear Cyborgs</i> is an effortless page turner that dares the reader to believe in the power of the imagination." &#x2015;Anelise Chen, <i>The Village Voice</i></p><p>"Eugene Lim's <i>Dear Cyborgs</i> is a novel of ideas, small, elegant ideas about art and protest, and one of the most striking literary works to emerge from the Occupy movement . . . The possible futility, complicity, and co-optation of protest are the ideas <i>Dear Cyborgs</i> circles around without ever giving up on the idea that resistance is essential . . . I had expected the decade's wave of protests to yield a raft of conventional social novels&#x2015;some earnest, some satirical, perhaps not a few reactionary&#x2015;but in <i>Dear Cyborgs</i> Lim has delivered something far more idiosyncratic, intricate, and useful: a novel that resists and subverts conventions at every turn." &#x2015;Christian Lorentzen, <i>New York</i></p><p>"[<i>Dear Cyborgs</i>] is stuffed with more complex ideas than many books three times its size . . .

It's a quirk that becomes a virtue in a novel about austerity, art, and everyday politics." &#x2015;Jonathon Sturgeon, <i>The Baffler</i></p><p>"<i>Dear Cyborgs</i> is as daring and exciting as it is thoughtful, and perhaps disheartening only because of the context in which it exists." &#x2015;Thomas Michael Duncan, <i>Necessary Fiction</i></p><p>"Two radically different story lines&#x2015;one involving a short-lived friendship between two Asian-American boys in the Midwest, the other an ongoing philosophical debate amongst a team of superheroes&#x2015;are cleverly tied together in this short, sly, unorthodox novel . . .

Presented in eye-catching, highly skimmable, fashion-magazine style, here's how to trade in the things that scream old lady (simply OL in the book) for a look that's younger and hipper (Y&amp;H). Krupp is straightforward about the physical shortcomings of older age. Aptly (and sometimes rather brutally) she steers readers away from these OL pitfalls. She is quick to point out that fashion that works on 20-somethings looks ridiculous on older women (i.e., bare midriffs, go-go boots and tattoos). As much about what to do as what not to do, some of the tips are as easy as wearing pink lipstick, a bra that fits properly and hair with bangs. Others take more thought, time and money&#x2014;like Botox shots, chemical peels and hair extensions. Whether high or low maintenance about their beauty routine, women of a certain age who want to compete in our youth-obsessed culture will treat this easy read with interest. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Why would Armando want your blood?" Something deep inside of my belly clenched, sending a rolling wave of nausea through me. "I don't know." Damian stared down at his fist. "Please don't do this. Please don't go. If you do ... they'll take you from me. Forever this time." He closed his eyes. "I can feel it. If you go, I will lose you." I crossed to where he stood and put my hand over his. When he looked into my face, his expression was bleak. "Together we can do anything, remember?" "But we aren't doing this together. You're going alone." With my free hand, I reached up to cup his face and gently pulled his mouth toward mine, until our lips met. He trembled beneath my touch, threatening to break apart. He'd let me past the careful wall he had built around himself for so many years, giving me the power to hurt him more deeply than I could probably imagine, and that knowledge made me want to scream and cry and never let him go. His arms came around me, his hands clutching at my tunic as he pressed my body against his. The desperation we battled seeped into our kiss, evidenced by the bitter taste of salt on my tongue from tears. I wanted to lose myself in the heat of his touch, in the need that pounded through my blood, coalescing in my limbs and belly. But I couldn't do that to him. I couldn't love him completely and then leave him alone. With a gasp, I tore myself away and he let me go. We stood motionless, breathing heavily, and then I said, "I'll come back. I promise." He just stared at me, silent and resigned. Summoning every ounce of strength I had, I turned and strode away, toward the curtain that hid the door to the passageway. Just when I lifted the fabric to pull it back Damian spoke. "I love you, Alexa." I didn't dare turn around and look at him, afraid it would be my undoing. "I love you, too." And then I stepped out of his sight and into the darkness.</p><h2>365 Days with Calvin: A Unique Collection of 365 Readings from the Writings of John Calvin (356 Days with)</h2><p>A unique collection of 365 readings from the writings of John Calvin, selected and edited by Joel R Beeke. John Calvin exercised a profound ministry in Europe, and is probably one of the most seminal thinkers ever to have lived. A godly pastor, theologian and preacher, he led his flock by example and worked hard to establish consistent godliness in his city. A prolific writer, his sermons, letters, and, of course, his Christian Institutes have been published again and again. His writings once described as flowing prose are characterized by clarity, simplicity, and yet profoundness, too. In these heart-warming pieces, drawn from his commentaries and sermons, Calvin brings us to Christ, the glorious Savior of all his people.</p><p>Joel R. Beeke, editor (Ph.D. Westminster Theological Seminary) is president and professor of systematic theology and homiletics at Puritan Reformed Theological Serminary, pastor of the Heritage Netherlands Reformed Congregation in Grand Rapids, Michigan, editor of The Banner of Sovereign Grace Truth, and author of numerous books.Daily devotionals spiritual aids to help us be accountable for a life of disciplined reading of Scripture and prayer have been around for centuries and need a certain caliber of excellence and insight if they are to prove of lasting value through 365 days! Of those I d like to spend a year with as my spiritual guide and mentor, John Calvin is most certainly one of them. Joel Beeke guides us through the Reformer s writings to help us discover the help and insight that every Christian needs to live a God-honoring life for Jesus Christ. --Derek W. H. Thomas, John E.

You&#39;ve read about the phenomenal growth of Recovery in newspapers and magazines. Now find out the real truth about Recovery. In contradicts science and medicine. It contradicts the Bible. It doesn&#39;t work. Nevertheless, millions of Americans have been led to believe that Recovery is the answer to addictive behavior. In this startling book you&#39;ll learn shocking facts like these: Even though 87% of Americans believe alcoholism is a disease, there is no scientific evidence to support the disease model of alcoholism. Yet the model provides the basis for nearly all Recovery programs. According to all available evidence, addicts in Recovery programs have no better recovery rate than those who receive no treatment at all. In spite of billions of dollars spent on Recovery, there are more alcoholics and drug addicts now than before the Recovery approach came into vogue. Though widely known to have Christian roots, Alcoholics Anonymous has more in common with Eastern religions than with Christianity. It&#39;s time to blow the whistle on the Recovery industry. The Useful Lie provides all the necessary evidence. More than that, it points the way toward genuine freedom from addiction.</p><p>William L.

Yet many of us demand this of other people's lives.<br><b>The danger of generalizations</b><br>As authors, we must declare ourselves on the very first pages of this book. It is impossible to interpret the lives of a people -- any people -- in one or two quick sentences. It seems a violent act.<br>When a people become the object of curiosity and tourism as the Amish and the Mennonites have in various parts of North America, a lot of shallow, fast-buck, one-line interpretations appear.<br>There are dozens of varieties among the Amish and Mennonite groups around the world. Words like "always" and "never" seldom apply in describing the whole Mennonite-Amish family. On most of the topics we will cover in this book, there are many shades of belief and practice among our various groups.<br>Our purpose is to qualify generalizations while being as specific as possible. This can be frustrating. We will use the words "most" and "some" and "seldom" a great deal. Many readers will wish we would make more sweeping observations. But one-line generalizations create human zoos. People become spectacles.<br>The various Amish and Mennonite groups of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, are the central focus of our study. We will attempt throughout the book, however, to include information about the worldwide peoplehood.<br><b>In general</b><br>We will risk several generalizations at this point:<br>1. Most Mennonite and Amish groups have common historical roots. Their beginnings (1525) date from a group of persecuted radical Christians nicknamed "Anabaptists" at the time of the Protestant Reformation in Europe. They sought a return to the simplicity of faith and practice as seen in the early Christian church in the Bible. The Amish division took place a century and a half later in 1693. This history will be discussed in detail in the next chapter.<br>2. All Amish and Mennonite groups are Christian fellowships. Most of them stress that belief must result in practice. "By their fruits you shall know them" (Matthew 7:20). Therefore, emphases on lifestyle and peace have distinguished most of the groups throughout the centuries. More on this in Chapter 3.<br></p><p>3. The differences among the various Amish and Mennonite groups through the years have almost always been ones of practice rather than basic Christian doctrine. This is not to minimize the differences, because they are real. But even today a survey of the whole family would show few differences on the Christian teaching of creation and redemption and a great many on how one should dress and how a congregation should make decisions.<br><b>More specifically</b><br>Amish groups tend to be more cautious on technology and involvement with the larger world than most Mennonites. Most Old Order Amish, for instance, drive horse-drawn carriages, dress "plain," refrain from the use of electricity, emphasize occupations close to the farm and the home, and forbid higher education. Many Mennonites, on the other hand, are considerably more acculturated. They embrace education and technology as opportunities, accept reluctantly the stress which modern life places on marriage and the family, and encourage an enlargement of the fellowship through worldwide missionary activities.<br>But this is very general. Thousands of Mennonites drive horses and buggies, avoid higher education, and are cautious on missions. And some Amish groups drive cars and encourage high school and mission work.<br>We find it more helpful for purposes of discussion to collect the many groups into two main categories: 1) those who take their cues for decision-making primarily from their faith fellowship, whom we shall refer to as "Old Order" (this may include many small urban groups who are "Old Order" in their dynamic); and 2) those who are more influenced in their primary decision-making by what the larger society thinks than by what their faith fellowship believes, whom we shall refer to as "modern."<br>These categories of "Old Order" and "modern" are much more helpful than "Mennonite" and "Amish" in describing the total family. In many cases, the Old Order Amish, the Old Order Mennonites, the Old Colony Mennonites, the Hutterites, and an inner-city Mennonite house church may share more in common than they do with more rapidly acculturating Mennonite and Amish groups.<br><b>In summary</b><br>One last comment. There are more similarities among the Mennonite-Amish fellowship worldwide than there are dissimilarities.<br>Obviously there are many differences, especially among the groups at the far edges of the spectrum. But there remain many unifying themes among the various Mennonite and Amish groups worldwide, even though the groups are organizationally independent.<br>The remainder of this book will explore both the differences and the likenesses of our peoples.<br><br></p></p><h2>The English Girl: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>ONE GIRL.

It's the story of how Beattie, the most popular writer on the controversial new-psychotherapy phenomenon, codependency, got through the experience of her 12-year-old son's fatal skiing accident and its aftermath. Like so many others who've endured the loss of a loved one, she drifted and obsessed, became a trial for her friends to be with and a prey for hucksters taking advantage of her distraction. She got through it all by reconnecting with her capacity to love--much needed because her daughter, drinking and drugging, was in the throes of midteen meltdown. That she's led a generally more melodramatic life than many certainly helps her account sustain reader interest. Those going through similar crises will find companionship and perhaps even solace in her report. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Emptiness and Omnipresence: An Essential Introduction to Tiantai Buddhism (World Philosophies)</h2><p><p>Tiantai Buddhism emerged from an idiosyncratic and innovative interpretation of the <i>Lotus Sutra</i> to become one of the most complete, systematic, and influential schools of philosophical thought developed in East Asia.

How could a simple diet relieve me of years of bloating, gas, pain, and bouts of diarrhea? I had never heard of nontropical sprue, the term he gave my disease.One week later I called his office. "You're a genius. I feel better already.""Just stick to that gluten-free diet and call me back when you start gaining some weight."By the end of the month I'd read everything I could find (and that wasn't much) about my condition, which had several names: nontropical sprue, celiac sprue, gluten sensitive enteropathy, and, finally, celiac disease. The symptoms were familiar--bloating, diarrhea, backaches, and often just plain stomachache. Others seemed to have constipation with their bloating, and others were only anemic. Another gluten-intolerant condition had symptoms of burning blisters, bumps, or lesions. It has just been in the last decade that those patients with DH (dermatitis herpetiformis) are considered celiacs and put on the gluten-free diet, for, when biopsied, they, too, show damage to the villi. This is really good news for these patients, although they may not consider it so at first, for they can usually reduce their medication slowly and most of them will be able to discontinue it completely as long as they stick to the diet.I also discovered that I was fortunate in having been diagnosed in the 1970s. Although physicians were aware of celiac disease long before that, until the 1950s there was no answer to what caused the distress symptoms. Many sufferers were limited to eating bananas and rice and were forbidden coarse foods such as other fruits, vegetables, and meat. It wasn't until after World War II that diets could be expanded, when doctors became aware that only the gluten in wheat, barley, rye, and oats was intolerable to patients with celiac disease.I soon realized, though, that with my improved health and renewed appetite, a diet without wheat, barley, rye, or oats was just plain boring. I didn't mind Cream of Rice for breakfast, but how could I live the rest of my life without bread or pasta or cake or stuffing in my turkey or ... The list became endless. One day I cheated and ate some freshly baked bread full of the forbidden glutens. The result of that spree was three days in bed suffering the same distress that had sent me to the doctor. I didn't tell him about my slip, but I resolved it would never happen again. Until medical science came up with a better cure for our disease, I'd stick to my diet. I also pledged myself to finding some way to make my food more interesting.Since I am the kind of noncook who left the plastic wrap on the corned beef the first time I tried boiling it and who had to look up the word <i>saut�</i> in the dictionary, I needed help. The health food stores had a couple of boxes of gluten-free baking mix, some rice and soy flours, and Hilda Cherry Hills's book <i>Good Food, Gluten Free</i>. Ms. Hills's book contained excellent advice on living, but frankly, the British recipes left me still searching for better taste.I found an organization called the Gluten Intolerance Group (GIG), which met at our local university school of medicine. Besides providing medical and dietary information, members exchanged cooking hints and recounted horror stories about their own years BD (before diagnosis). I learned I was not alone. In 1990 it was estimated there were over a hundred thousand celiacs in the United States. Even then it was suggested that this may only have been the tip of the iceberg, for many doctors miss the diagnosis--a patient may not recount all his or her symptoms because they sound so diverse. Even more confusing for the patient and the doctor is the fact that celiac sprue symptoms can mimic many other disorders.Very slowly the doctors are becoming more aware of the condition, and in 1997 nationwide blood screening was started for celiac disease. The iceberg is being slowly uncovered. The estimate is running closer to one million celiacs in the United States at this time. With the new and noninvasive blood tests just developed a few years ago, a doctor can screen patients with symptoms first before suggesting the more drastic endoscopy and biopsy. This is now advised for all first- and second-degree relatives of celiacs, for preliminary findings show that approximately 5.7 percent of first-degree relatives and 3.1 percent of second-degree relatives will test positive for the disease. Many of these may have no symptoms as yet, and getting on the diet early may save them from having any of the damaging effects of celiac disease. This damage can cause malabsorption of food and lead to possible anemia, malnutrition, calcium deficiency, mental and/or physical fatigue, or other problems.I was not aware of any of these possible problems, nor were most people in 1974, but finding that I was not alone with a "rare" disease made me look for more answers. Since then I have joined other celiac groups, become more informed via the increasing amount of literature and medical reports on celiac disease, and have attended national and local conferences in both the United States and Canada. A speaker at one of those conferences described our disease picturesquely: The celiac's immune system mistakes gluten for an enemy and, while fighting it in the gut, flattens or blunts the villi. A healthy villi can be compared to a shag carpet in the intestines soaking up nutrients: the celiac gut resembles linoleum, allowing nutrients to slide unused to the exit.At the time I was diagnosed, the only flour used for baking was rice, but I soon found that there were other tasty flours we could use: sweet rice, potato, potato starch, soy, tapioca, cornstarch, corn flour, cornmeal, and buckwheat. In the last ten years we've added flours from beans and sorghum, and several of the national organizations recognize that the flours and cereals of amaranth, quinoa, tef, and millet do not contain the toxic gluten. Canada has always considered them gluten-free and allowed them in their celiac diet.With this wide choice of flours I've discovered it is possible to make good breads, cakes, cookies, and casseroles. I've even baked pizza and lasagne successfully. I stuff my turkey at Thanksgiving and eat plum pudding at Christmas and hot cross buns at Easter. I feed the family and any guests using my diet, and they never suspect they are eating gluten-free foods. In fact, I am often asked for my recipes.Today the newly diagnosed celiac is more fortunate than I was twenty-five years ago. He or she can join national groups with a chapter nearby, has the choice of more cookbooks, and can find gluten-free bread and mixes in some health food stores or can order, by mail or phone, diet breads, rolls, cookies, gluten-free pasta, and even full main dishes.Scientists have made progress on the disease, but to date they have not come up with any way other than diet to stop the gliadin factor in gluten from damaging the small intestine. Staying on a gluten-free diet is still the only known way to regain health and remain in remission.Now I am not even impatient for science to discover some miraculous cure for our disease. With my weight back to normal and my energy high, I eat well within the limitations of the gluten-free diet. I don't think of it as a diet for life, I consider it a prescription for living.As with any prescription, it has to be filled, and the simplest way to do this is to join a support group--local or national--with a knowledgeable leader. Dieticians and nutritionists are still struggling to understand both cooking with the difficult flours and finding and eliminating hidden gluten, but anyone on the diet soon learns what he/she can have and is more than willing to share at meetings and in the many well-researched newsletters.There are also two national publications offering information about the disease and a site on the Internet. <i>Caution</i>: The Internet has become a sounding board with a lot of information, but this is not monitored so be selective about what you accept when you read it on the screen.For more information about celiac disease or to find a group near you, contact one of these national organizations:&nbsp;<br><b>American Celiac Society Dietary Support Coalition,</b> <i>59</i> Crystal Avenue, West Orange, NJ 07052-3570; (973) 325-8837<b>Canadian Celiac Association,</b> 190 Britannia Road East, Unit 11, Mississauga, Ontario L4Z 1W6, Canada; (905) 507-6208 or (800) 363-7296<b>Celiac Disease Foundation,</b> 13251 Ventura Blvd., Suite 1, Studio City, CA 91604-1838; (818) 990-2354; fax (818) 990-2397<b>Celiac Sprue Association/United States of America (CSA/USA),</b> P.O.

Outside of the terminology for Israel itself, the Canaanites are the most common ethnic group found in the Bible. They are positioned as the foil of the nation of Israel, and the land of Canaan is depicted as the promised allotment of Abraham and his descendants. The terms Canaan and Canaanites are even evoked in modern political discourse, indicating that their importance extends into the present. With such prominent positioning, it is important to gain a more complete and historically accurate perspective of the Canaanites, their land, history, and rich cultural heritage. So, who were the Canaanites? Where did they live, what did they believe, what do we know about their culture and history, and why do they feature so prominently in the biblical narratives? In this volume, Mary Buck uses original textual and archaeological evidence to answer to these questions.

What is the link between our own mental health and the health of the greater biosphere? In this &#34;bold, ambitious, philosophical essay&#34; (Publishers Weekly), historian and cultural critic Roszak explores the relationships between psychology, ecology, and new scientific insights into systems in nature. Drawing on our understanding of the evolutionary, self-organizing universe, Roszak illuminates our rootedness in the greater web of life and explores the relationship between our own sanity and the larger-than-human world. The Voice of the Earth seeks to bridge the centuries-old split between the psychological and the ecological with a paradigm which sees the needs of the planet and the needs of the person as a continuum. The Earth&#39;s cry for rescue from the punishing weight of the industrial system we have created is our own cry for a scale and quality of life that will free us to become whole and healthy. This second edition contains a new afterword by the author.</p><p>Theodore Roszak is the author of The Making of a Counterculture, Where the Wasteland Ends, The Gendered Atom, and other works of nonfiction. His novels include Flicker and The Memoirs of Elizabeth Frankenstein, which is currently being made into a motion picture. Roszak lives in Berkeley and is professor of history at California State University, Hayward. A Guggenheim Fellowship recipient, he has twice been nominated for the National Book Award.Repeatedly, in this scholarly survey of cultural history, Roszak (History/California State Univ.; Flicker, 1991, etc.) evokes a back-to-nature philosophy, contrasting the rational philosophy of the Enlightenment with the romanticism of the noble savage; prehistoric animism and earth-mother religion with the rise of patriarchy and male-dominated, nature-dominating religion. All this by way of elaborating what he sees as the only salvation of the ecological crisis: a new ``ecopsychology.'' The new school celebrates the individual, seen in harmonious interrelationships with the family, society, Mother Earth, and, ultimately, the cosmos. Ecopsychology is informed by various post- Freudian schools: some Jung (collective unconscious), and something of Reich, Maslow, Gestalt psychology, and various California-style movements--in general, those schools that look upon the unconscious as the well-spring of creativity. ``The core of the mind is the ecological unconscious,'' Roszak says, containing ``the living record of cosmic evolution, tracing back to distant initial conditions in the history of time.'' Yes, time's arrow and the evolution of the cosmos figure large in Roszak's philosophy. Taking the Big Bang as a given, and borrowing arguments from systems theory, the Gaia hypothesis, and the anthropic principle, he sees the emergence of humanity as inevitable in the grand scheme of things. It follows, then, that we must get back on track with Mother Earth. How to do this finds Roszak lamenting urban- industrial society. Cities are bad. Deep ecology is good. The restorative work must begin in childhood, and must involve a breaking away from macho ideas and the invoking of some concepts of ecofeminism. Roszak turns a fine sentence and knows his history (if not his science), but his idealism pays no mind to the population problem, poverty, disease, or rising racial-ethnic conflicts; and it dismisses the cultural largesse of cities and pays scant homage to what science and technology might do. In short, there seems to be more wish than reality here. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The source of this power is the voodoo religion, and its queen is Marie Laveau, the notorious voodooienne, worshipped and feared by blacks and whites alike.</p></p><p><b>Jewell Parker Rhodes&nbsp;</b>is the author of&nbsp;<i>Ninth Ward</i>, a Coretta Scott King honor book, and&nbsp;<i>Sugar</i>, winner of the Jane Adams Peace Association book award. She has also written many award-winning books for adults. Jewell lives with her family in Arizona.A gripping first novel that limns the life of African-American Marie Laveau, the legendary Voodoo Queen of New Orleans, with all the brooding intensity and latent menace of a summer's night on a lonely bayou. Assembling scattered references to Laveau in Creole folklore, Rhodes not only tells a riveting story but creates a panoramic portrait of New Orleans life in the early 1800's. Like a Dickensian London, the city where Marie confronts her destiny is a vibrant place teeming with Creoles, slaves, free blacks, aristo descendants of the French and Spanish settlers, and Yankees. Marie is a direct descendant of Membe, who, instructed by Damballah, the great snake god, became a slave so that she could mother the god's lost children in America. As Marie lies dying, an old woman revered for her good deeds, she tells her story to lifelong admirer Louis Delavier. Beginning in the middle--since ``the middle is the beginning of everything. Everything spirals from the center. Lies, pain, and loss haunt the future as well as the past''--she describes how she deliberately let her python, with whom she shared the spirit of Damballah, murder John--her Svengali, her nemesis. She then goes on to recall the happiest years of her life--her childhood with grandmother Marie in rural Tech&#x201a;, where on her tenth birthday she not only saw visions but had a frightening encounter with a man who ``smelled of ash and withered leaves.'' The man is John, who, sold into slavery, is interested in voodoo only for his own ends. He later seduces young Marie, exploits her visionary gifts, and ruthlessly destroys all those who thwart him. Marie's murder of John alienates her from her daughter, but--reconciling her Catholic upbringing with voodoo, an affirmative power when properly handled--she becomes a noted healer. All the ingredients of a bewitching read--atmosphere, adventure, mystery, and romance--as well as enough intellectual substance to give it a satisfying heft. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Over forty U.S. cities passed similar laws during this time, yet little is known about their emergence, operations, or effects. Grounded in a wealth of archival material, <i>Arresting Dress</i> traces the career of anti-cross-dressing laws from municipal courtrooms and codebooks to newspaper scandals, vaudevillian theater, freak-show performances, and commercial &#x201c;slumming tours.&#x201d; It shows that the law did not simply police normative gender but actively produced it by creating new definitions of gender normality and abnormality. It also tells the story of the tenacity of those who defied the law, spoke out when sentenced, and articulated different gender possibilities.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Clare Sears is Associate Professor of Sociology and Sexuality Studies at San Francisco State University.<br>"Don't let the subtitle of Clare Sears's important new book fool you into thinking this is a narrow investigation of an obscure law in a small city a long time ago. It's filled with big ideas about bodies and spaces and norms, about the generative as well as disciplinary function of the law, and about the historical transience of gender categories as well as the persistence of transgendering practices. Sears's powerful analytical framework allows her to connect the exclusion of gender nonconformers from the public sphere with similar exclusions of raced and disabled bodies, while her crystal-clear prose and compelling archival stories never let the reader get lost in the weeds of excessive theorization. A great book for undergraduates and specialists alike." -- Susan Stryker, author of, <i>Transgender History</i></p><h2>Raven Stole the Moon: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Deeply moving, superbly crafted, and highly unconventional.&#x201d; </strong><strong>&#x2014;<em>Washington Times</em></strong></p><p><em><strong>Raven Stole the Moon </strong></em><strong>is the stunning first novel from Garth Stein, author of the phenomenal <em>New York Times </em>bestseller <em>The Art of Racing in the Rain</em>.</strong> </p><p>A profoundly poignant and unforgettable story of a grieving mother&#x2019;s return to a remote Alaskan town to make peace with the loss of her young son, <em>Raven Stole the Moon</em> combines intense emotion with Native American mysticism and a timeless and terrifying mystery, and earned raves for a young writer and his uniquely captivating imagination. </p><p>According to the <em>Fort Worth Star-Telegram, </em>this remarkable novel &#x201c;serves notice that Stein is a rare talent.&#x201d;</p></p><p>On impulse, Jenna Rosen leaves the party she and her real estate developer husband, Robert, are attending in Seattle, takes his BMW and drives north to Bellingham. Again on impulse, she hops on the ferry to the Alaskan town where her Tlingit Indian grandmother lived and died. But there&#39;s more than impulse at work here: Jenna and Robert&#39;s 5-year-old son, Bobby, drowned in Alaska just two years ago, and something is drawing Jenna back to the scene. On the ferry, she&#39;s given a carved silver charm of a Tlingit spirit called a kushtaka, a stealer of souls. &#34;Tlingits don&#39;t have good and evil,&#34; a local shaman explains, telling the story of how the spirit known as Raven gave the world the sun, moon, and stars by stealing them from someone else. As Jenna learns more about the kushtakas, helped by this very sophisticated shaman and an understanding fisherman, she begins to believe that her son&#39;s soul is being held captive by these spirits, as revenge for her husband&#39;s greed. Garth Stein&#39;s persuasive prose draws us into a book that mixes fantasy with tragedy and the natural human desire for closure.<blockquote><p>From the author of the acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Art of Racing in the Rain</em> comes an extraordinary tale of grief, devotion, redemption, and timeless mystery.</p></blockquote><p>When Jenna Rosen abandons her comfortable Seattle life to visit Wrangell, Alaska, it's a wrenching return to her past. The hometown of her Native American grandmother, Wrangell is located near the Thunder Bay Resort, where Jenna's young son, Bobby, disappeared two years before. His body was never recovered, and Jenna is determined to lay to rest the aching mystery of his death. But whispers of ancient legends begin to suggest a frightening new possibility about Bobby's fate, and Jenna must sift through the beliefs of her ancestors, the Tlingit, who still tell of powerful, menacing forces at work in the Alaskan wilderness. Armed with nothing but a mother's protective instincts, Jenna's quest for the truth behind her son's disappearance is about to pull her into a terrifying and life-changing abyss.</p></p><h2>Prom</h2><p>Philadelphia high school who doesn&#x2019;t care about the prom. It&#x2019;s pretty much the only good thing that happens there, and everyone plans to make the most of it&#x2014;especially Ash&#x2019;s best friend, Natalia, who&#x2019;s the head of the committee and has prom stars in her eyes. Then the faculty advisor is busted for taking the prom money and Ash finds herself roped into putting together a gala dance. But she has plenty of help&#x2014;from her large and loving (if exasperating!) family, from Nat&#x2019;s eccentric grandmother, from the principal, from her fellow classmates. And in making the prom happen, Ash learns some surprising things about making her life happen, too.</p><p>Ages 12 and up. Who would have thought the author of the gritty classic <i>Speak</i> had a gift for comedy? Here she demonstrates her comedic talent in the warm and witty story of Ashley, who is definitely not a prom-type person, and her best friend Nat, who lives for the prom. When the math teacher disappears with the funds just eleven days before the dance, determined and organized Nat goes into high gear to find alternative ways to make the prom happen and drags an unwilling Ashley into the flurry of urgent details. <p> Ashley has enough problems in her life already, starting with the complexities of her crowded but loving working class family -- her extremely pregnant mother and her three exuberant and prom-crazy aunts, and her cab-driving father and three younger brothers, who think nothing of happily trashing the kitchen in a game of hot dog baseball. Then there&#x2019;s Mr. Gilroy, the evil vice principal of discipline, who has Ashley on endless detention, her awful job at EZ-CHEEZ-E, where she has trouble seeing the customers through the eyeholes of her rat costume, and her good-looking but lowlife boyfriend TJ, who wants her to join him in a future as depressing as the dank one-room apartment he has so proudly rented for them. Not to speak of Nat&#x2019;s loony grandmother, who wears her red bathing cap even when she&#x2019;s not doing the backstroke in a wading pool, babbles at Ashley in Russian, and spits on the floor to show her disapproval. </p><p> But in the end it&#x2019;s grandma with her skill at baking (pastries to bribe the custodians) and sewing (a magical prom dress) who saves both the prom and Ashley&#x2019;s belief in herself and her future in this delightful and heartfelt novel. <i>--Patty Campbell</i></p>Laurie Halse Anderson has received both the Margaret Edwards Award and the ALAN Award for her contributions to young adult literature.

Why has it happened at all? Could it have happened in a radically different way? What should we make of the disproportionate role of the West in shaping the world we currently live in? This witty, intelligent hopscotch through human history addresses these questions and more. Michael Cook sifts the human career on earth for the most telling nuggets and then uses them to elucidate the whole. From the calendars of Mesoamerica and the temple courtesans of medieval India to the intricacies of marriage among an aboriginal Australian tribe, Cook explains the sometimes eccentric variety in human cultural expression. He guides us from the prehistoric origins of human history across the globe through the increasing unification of the world, first by Muslims and then by European Christians in the modern period, illuminating the contingencies that have governed broad historical change. "A smart, literate survey of human life from paleolithic times until 9/11."&#x2015;Edward Rothstein, <em>The New York Times</em> 11 maps, 28 illustrations</p><p>Michael Cook, a specialist in Islamic history, is Cleveland E. Dodge Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University.Princeton University professor Cook, a specialist in Islamic history, ambitiously attempts to convey the general shape of human history over the last 10,000 years. As Cook makes clear from the outset, we're in the midst of a lucky spell regarding global climate, which has been mild over the last several millennia. Taking advantage of this "window of opportunity," humans began to do something revolutionary: farm. Cook emphasizes that farming was the beginning of civilization, and it all started in the Middle East. Cook's focus on the impact of environment and geography is clear in his chapter on Africa, "in which we can expect the history of the continent to be marked by a steep cultural gradient, with the advantage going to the north," where close contact with Eurasia and more suitable climate led to farming and the domestication of animals earlier than in the south. Cook's method is to first sketch an overview of a particular region's history, and then to analyze in depth a couple of its cultural developments. Thus, he offers us interesting explorations of Greek pottery, Chinese ancestor cults and marriage rites among Australian aborigines. Toward the end of his survey, Cook examines the rise of industrialism in Britain and how it posed a challenge to the rest of the world. One highly relevant challenge to Western modernity that Cook emphasizes is Islamic fundamentalism. While Cook does an excellent job covering the main themes of world history, his narrative at times reads like a college survey course: lots of enticing information, but too sweeping. 15 maps, 30 illus. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Power of Infinite Love &amp; Gratitude: An Evolutionary Journey to Awakening Your Spirit</h2><p><p>Would you like to discover your infinite potential for healing and moving through life&#x2019;s challenges?&nbsp; If so, <strong><em>The Power of Infinite Love &amp; Gratitude</em></strong> by <strong>Dr. Darren R.

Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma 1/2 from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008.

Greenman and George Kalantzis, marks another compilation from the Wheaton Theology Conference. 2009&#39;s event produced the wealth of work represented here exploring the theological foundations for a faithful approach to the church practices that contribute to spiritual formation, that is, to our sanctification in the power of the Holy Spirit. Including essays from keynote speakers Dallas Willard and Gordon Fee as well as contributing essays by noted presenters such as Chris Hall, David Gushee, Linda Cannell, Cherith Fee Nordling and Lawrence Cunningham, this book offers a stimulating exploration of the historical, biblical and theological dimensions of spiritual formation. It will be of special interest to those who serve as pastors, spiritual directors, church ministry leaders and Christian educators.</p><p><strong>Jeffrey P.

It respects Jesus&#39;s Jewish heritage, locating him clearly in the complex and vibrant context of first-century Jerusalem. At the same time, it graphically presents the differing portraits of Jesus as they appear in the four Gospels, paying special attention to the accounts of his death and resurrection. Those who take up this book and read it will not only grow in their understanding of the biblical texts but will also find a rich source for spiritual reflection.&#34;&#34; --Most Rev. Anthony M. Pilla, Bishop Emeritus of Cleveland &#34;&#34;[This book] invites the reader into the world of Jesus and the disciples, encouraging him or her to experience with them the life of first-century Palestine. The opening chapters are especially significant in their presentation of the contextual foundation of Jesus the Jew, revealing his own formation and growth as a devout Jew in a period of turmoil for the Jewish people. I would find the book especially useful as an introductory text for introductory religion and Christology courses at the college level and for adult education programs. It provides new insights into Jesus and his ministry which are especially meaningful for today.&#34;&#34; --Diana L. Hayes, Professor of Systematic Theology, Georgetown University &#34;&#34;Finally, a book about Jesus that is both &#39;user friendly&#39; and deeply insightful. This is a classy and deeply spiritual look at the Jesus of our faith, a Jesus we can approach without fear, and yet a Jesus who still awakens us and keeps us filled with awe and wonder.

When he got mad his face turned as red as his hair, earning him the nickname "Captaine Shrimpe." <br><br>It's a story that has been told for almost 400 years&#x2014;how a brave band of people set sail on the <i>Mayflower</i> to find a new life in America. <br><br>By weaving her chatty, narrative text with her incredibly detailed artwork, award-winning author-illustrator Cheryl Harness makes readers feel as though they are part of the adventure. <br><br>Students will discover all sorts of things they never knew before: that a teenage boy almost blew up the <i>Mayflower</i> and that the first Indian the Pilgrims met greeted them in English! They'll learn more serious things, too: all about why they came, the hardships they suffered, the people they met, and the successes they achieved. <br><br>Middle-graders will experience one of history's great adventures as only Cheryl Harness can tell it.</p><p>Cheryl Harness is the author and/or illustrator of some 35 books for children. Visit this award-winning author-illustrator on the Web at www.cherylharness.com.Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Harness combines a breezy tone with exhaustively researched texts to produce not only exemplary life stories, but also snapshots of the periods. As the author makes amply clear, Standish was a hotheaded but effective secretary of defense for the struggling Plymouth Colony. His willingness to make a show of force and to invest both time and effort (his own and others') into constructing fortresses probably saved the fledgling colony from untimely destruction. The steps Whitman took to become a missionary, her historic journey to Oregon country, her years at the Waiilatpu Mission, and her tragic death at age 39 are all covered. The narrative is much enhanced by the frequent use of excerpts from her letters home. In each book, a running time line lists significant events taking place in Europe, Africa, and Asia. The texts incorporate information on the state of technology and how that impacted the journeys each individual made, the force and impact of religious beliefs and worldviews, and significant societal beliefs and mores. Black-and-white line illustrations extend the texts beautifully, as do the maps. The bibliographies and indexes are excellent. While readers may not pick these titles up on their own, Harness's style (though a bit arch in tone at times) will hold their interest. Much preferable to most standard series titles, such as Louis Sabin's <i>Narcissa Whitman: Brave Pioneer</i> (Troll, 1997), these books have a place in most school collections.&#x2014;<i>Ann Welton, Helen B.

In Hero Maker you will learn how to bring real change to your church and community by developing the practical skills to help others reach their leadership potential. Drawing on five powerful practices found in the ministry of Jesus, Hero Maker presents the key steps of apprenticeship that will build up other leaders and provides strategies for how you can activate gifts, help others take ownership, and develop a simple scorecard for measuring your kingdom-building progress. Besides rich insights from the Gospels, Hero Maker is packed with real-life ministry stories ranging from paid staff to volunteer leaders and from established churches to new church plants. A practical tool accompanies each of the five practices, with several illustrations for how to use it. Whether you lead ten people or ten thousand, Hero Maker will not only help you maximize your leadership, but in doing so you will also help shift today&#39;s church culture to a model of reproduction and multiplication. Authors Dave Ferguson (a Chicago pastor and church planter) and Warren Bird (an award-winning writer) make a compelling case that God&#39;s power and purpose are best revealed when we train and release others, who in turn do likewise. Become that rare breed of leader who brings change into our world by sacrificially investing in others who become the heroes. By becoming a hero maker, you will join a movement of influencers that are impacting hundreds, thousands and perhaps millions of people around the world.</p><p></p><h2>Conversations With The Merciful God</h2><p>Conversations With The Merciful God [Mass Market Paperback] [Jan 01, 2003] Ko...</p><p>Fr.

Utterly delightful."--Nalo Hopkinson<br><br>Karen Lord's debut novel, which won the prestigious Frank Collymore Literary Prize in Barbados, is an intricately woven tale of adventure, magic, and the power of the human spirit.<br> Paama's husband is a fool and a glutton. Bad enough that he followed her to her parents' home in the village of Makendha, now he's disgraced himself by murdering livestock and stealing corn. When Paama leaves him for good, she attracts the attention of the undying ones--the djombi--who present her with a gift: the Chaos Stick, which allows her to manipulate the subtle forces of the world. Unfortunately, a wrathful djombi with indigo skin believes this power should be his and his alone.<br> Bursting with humor and rich in fantastic detail, <i>Redemption in Indigo</i> is a clever, contemporary fairy tale that introduces readers to a dynamic new voice in Caribbean literature. Lord's world of spider tricksters and indigo immortals, inspired in part by a Senegalese folk tale, will feel instantly familiar--but Paama's adventures are fresh, surprising, and utterly original.</p><p>Karen Lord was born in Barbados in 1968. She holds a science degree from the University of Toronto and a PhD in the sociology of religion from The University of Wales. She has taught physics, trained soldiers, and worked in the Foreign Service. This is her first novel.*Starred Review* Lord is Barbadian, and her first novel retells a Senegalese legend, setting it in a world not unlike the village West Africa of Ousmane Semb�ne's films. In it, humans and the undying spirits of such qualities as patience and chance as well as of tricksters, great (a spider, of course) and lesser, interact. In little Makende, Paama, who is a great cook, has returned to her family after 10 years of marriage to the gluttonous Ansige. To chastise Chance, Patience has seized the Chaos Stick, which can alter human disasters if seldom dispel them, and decided to give it to Paama. Chance's elaborate efforts to induce Paama to give it back to him constitute the principal strain of the plot, from which the narrator diverges in every other chapter to account for other characters who impinge on the main action. A great deal happens in the novel's relatively short course, but confusion is minimal because Lord has found the ideal voice for the narrator&#x2014;feminine yet authoritative, amusing yet soothing, omniscient yet humble. This is one of those literary works of which it can be said that not a word should be changed. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Healing Trauma Through Self-Parenting: The Codependency Connection</h2><p>Self-healing through self-parenting, a concept introduced a generation ago, has helped thousands of adult children of alcoholics who are codependent and have conflicts in their primary relationships. Now Patricia O'Gorman, Ph.D., and Phil Diaz, M.S.W., authors of the classic book<i> The 12 Steps to Self-Parenting for Adult Children</i> and its companion workbook,<i> </i>expand the reach of that successful healing paradigm to anyone who has suffered from any kind of trauma. Whether they grew up in a dysfunctional home, were victims of violence, or suffered other types of acute distress, many people struggle to determine the impact of earlier trauma on current adult decision making. O'Gorman and Diaz show how trauma is a driver of dysfunctional behaviors and linked with codependency, and they offer a concise yet detailed resource for survivors and thrivers as well as the professionals who work with them. Through a process modeled after the 12 Steps of AA, <i>Healing Trauma Through Self-Parenting: The Codependency Connection </i>offers help to a broad array of readers (not just those who are ACOAs) by healing the wounded inner core and helping readers reconnect to their inner child.</p><p>Phil Diaz, M.S.W., is the director of community development and education for Behavioral Health of the Palm Beaches in Palm Beach, Florida, and has a private practice specializing in the treatment of addiction and trauma at Lifescape Solutions in Delray Beach, Florida. He is the former executive director of the Harrigan Foundation, where he specialized in Gestalt family therapy, and the former CEO of Gateway Community Services, a 300-bed drug treatment facility for adolescents and adults in Jacksonville, Florida, where he pioneered PTSD treatment using EMDR and motivational therapy. Patricia O'Gorman, Ph.D., a psychologist in private practice in East Chatham and Albany, New York, is noted for her work in trauma, families, children of alcoholics, child welfare, mental health, and substance abuse. She was one of the first researchers on children of alcoholics in the early 1970s, documenting the impact of alcoholism and sobriety on adolescent development, and went on to create the Department of Prevention and Education for the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (NCADD). Dr. O'Gorman is a cofounder of the National Association for Children of Alcoholics, and she has held positions that include clinical director of a child welfare agency, executive director of an agency serving survivors of crime and abuse, and director of prevention for NIAAA. She is a veteran of numerous television appearances, including <i>Good Morning America, Today,</i> and <i>AM Sunday</i>. She is the author of numerous books and articles in magazines including <i>Addiction Today</i>,<i> Counselor</i>, and <i>Recovery</i>. She brings the same type of seminal thinking to the topic of trauma and codependency that she used to help create the Children of Alcoholics movement.<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p><strong>Trauma: The Missing Link</strong></p> <p><i>It's never too late to be who you might have been.<br></i>&#x2015;George Eliot</p> <p>Trauma surrounds us. Recent studies show that exposure to traumatic stress is higher than previously understood. Given that trauma exposure is becoming more common&#x2015;as is awareness about that exposure&#x2015;it is interesting that most people who have been impacted by trauma do not think of themselves as trauma survivors. For example, serious illness in oneself or one's child; losing a job or a home; losing a spouse to death or divorce; working in an ER as a nurse; or volunteering to do recovery work after a natural disaster&#x2015;all these can be traumatic. So, too, is the impact of deployment on our military men and women and their families. Because many trauma survivors don't identify themselves as traumatized, they are 'invisible.'</p> <p>There is one exception to this tendency not to identify as being traumatized. Survivors of pervasive or complex trauma (see Chapter 1 for more about complex and other traumas) more easily label themselves as trauma survivors. Such survivors, including adult children of alcoholics and children of other types of challenging families, have suffered a more subtle kind of trauma that left them wounded and searching for wholeness. They seek therapy, read books, attend conferences, and go to Al-Anon meetings&#x2015;all in an attempt to right something that they experienced. Once they appreciate their own trauma histories and their resilience, they begin to address the way that their trauma manifested for them&#x2015;the only way&#x2015;the one thing that really caught their attention: their need to care for others. This is codependency&#x2015;a type of attachment to others where there is a tendency not to take care of oneself while simultaneously seeing to what everyone else needs. (See Chapter 3 for a full discussion of codependency.)</p> <p>Research&#x2015;as well as anecdotal evidence from our patients, conference attendees, and readers&#x2015;shows that what lies at the base of the struggle with codependency&#x2015;that is, why people cannot take active care of themselves and why the needs of others feel more imperative than their own<i>&#x2015;</i><i>is a response to trauma</i>. Whether this trauma occurred early in childhood or is more recent doesn't matter. Trauma is indeed proving to be the missing link in the codependency field.</p> <p>For an adult, trauma is defined as exposure to a one-time event, numerous exposures to horrific events, or ongoing exposure to events such as war or domestic violence that profoundly and negatively affect the person. For children, ongoing neglect or abuse, as well as exposure to a one-time or ongoing horrific event(s), constitute traumatic exposure. Recently, research has expanded our understanding of the impact of trauma to possibly include those who live with someone who has been traumatized, such as family members of veterans who themselves are experiencing signs of trauma. Long neglected and misunderstood by healthcare professionals and survivors alike, trauma is now being seen as a driver of behavior by both the treatment community and those who have experienced its destructive force&#x2015;a driver that we need to comprehend more fully.</p> <p>We humans are complex and multifaceted. Many of us know trauma intimately. Trauma and the resulting codependency (with their many faces and numerous presentations) serve to underscore our need to take care of ourselves and the price we pay when we do not. The good news is that finally trauma and codependency are beginning to command the attention they deserve&#x2015;and so are effective strategies for managing them, like self-parenting!</p> <p>Self-parenting is about guiding yourself through a process that allows you to become who you would like to be&#x2015;who you were meant to be&#x2015;by healing yourself through caring for yourself. How well we learn to self-parent determines how well we go through life.</p> <p>Trauma researchers have recently proclaimed the need for those impacted by trauma to become the parent to themselves that they needed growing up (Fogash and Copeley 2008). We in the codependency community have known for years that this self-parenting is possible and that it works very well!</p> <p><i>Healing Trauma Through Self-Parenting&#x2015;The Codependency Connection</i> is the first book written for those who have developed codependency as a coping skill after experiencing trauma. It is a survivor's book&#x2015;or as we say with our strength-based focus, a <i>thriver</i>'s<i> </i>book&#x2015;providing a personal focus for those affected. It is invaluable to those who are looking for a resource to help them heal, and it's a useful tool for professionals as a needed and valuable resource in their work with their clients. It complements the growing literature on both trauma and codependency by offering a simple process that readers can employ to begin their healing: the process of self-parenting. We will take you through this transformative process of becoming the parent that you have always needed, a process we have specifically tailored for those healing from trauma and its subsequent codependency.</p> <p>We will teach you how to parent yourself by identifying and helping you soothe the pain of your trauma on psychological, neurobiological, and spiritual levels. We will assist you in identifying, owning, and growing your hard-won resilience, and we will guide you in charting your recovery as you begin to celebrate who you are today, not just what you can do for others. We will help you accomplish all these things through the use of the self-parenting techniques, affirmations, and self-soothing exercises described in Part Two of this book. The self-parenting process is complemented by information on trauma, codependency, the neurobiology of trauma, the twelve principles of healing, and other sources of support that are available.</p> <p>This book is our gift to you&#x2015;and to those of you who have worked with us, shared your stories, and made us aware of the connection between trauma and codependency. We hope the process of self-parenting as it relates to trauma and codependency will be meaningful to you on a deep and healing level, and we invite you to share your thoughts with us at www.ogormandiaz.com.

That is the stark conclusion of this comprehensive investigation into the Chinese state&#39;s secret program to get rid of political dissidents while profiting from the sale of their organs--in many cases to Western recipients. Based on interviews with top-ranking police officials and Chinese doctors who have killed prisoners on the operating table, veteran China analyst Ethan Gutmann has produced a riveting insider&#39;s account--culminating in a death toll that will shock the world. Why would the Chinese leadership encourage such a dangerous perversion of their medical system? To solve the puzzle, Gutmann journeyed deep into the dissident archipelago of Falun Gong, Tibetans, Uighurs and House Christians, uncovering an ageless drama of resistance, eliciting confessions of deep betrayal and moments of ecstatic redemption. In an age of compassion fatigue, Gutmann relies on one simple truth: those who have made it back from the gates of hell have stories to tell.

For the 1999 edition, Williams has written a new preface and a new epilogue, "On/scenities," illustrated with 25 photographs. She has also added a supplementary bibliography.</p><p><b>Linda Williams</b> is Professor of Film Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of <i>Figures of Desire: A Theory and Analysis of Surrealist Film</i> (California, 1981) and editor of <i>Viewing Positions: Ways of Seeing Film</i> (1995).In academic prose, film professor Williams of the University of California offers a graphic analysis of hard-core porno movies such as Deep Throat , as well as early, anonymous stag flicks. She finds that the newer, "softer" X-rated rental videos "show a more genuinely adult quality" than earlier videos. She ponders the "utopian problem-solving intent" of the hard-core genre and makes specious comparisons between blue movies, Hollywood musicals and films like Dirty Dancing . Sadomasochistic porn films, she claims, let viewers experience "a clearer confrontation with the oscillating poles of our gendered identities and the role of power in them." A critic whose professed goal is to understand film pornography, and who opposes those who would censor it, Williams begins this obfuscating study by analyzing the portrayal of women in the 19th-century kinetoscope, prototype of the motion-picture projector. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Luna Cognita: A Comprehensive Observer&#x2019;s Handbook of the Known Moon, Volume 1,2,3</h2><p><i>Luna Cognita</i> takes the readers on a journey of the Moon, from first learning about the Moon&#x2019;s place in mankind&#x2019;s history, mythology and lore, to gravitating closer to the Moon itself.

In this fourth edition-the Fiftieth Anniversary Edition-authors Jon M. Ericson, James J. Murphy, and Raymond Bud Zeuschner have made significant revisions to improve the depth, flow, and clarity of this popular debater's handbook.<br><br>With straightforward explanations and specific applications geared toward contemporary debate practice, this compact volume offers students and teachers clear-cut assistance in resolving the key problem faced by debaters: the need to present arguments forcefully and cogently while reacting effectively to criticism. Beginning with a candid explanation of the basic principles of debate, The Debater's Guide then introduces the steps to building a case, from reviewing strategies for refutation and defense to engaging in cross-examination, solid research, and critical thinking. It advises readers on a wide range of important topics, from budgeting time in a debate to speaking in outline form by using a well-organized series of explanations, specific examples, and graphic presentations related to both policy and value issues. The authors apply these concepts to a variety of formats and situations commonly found in high school and collegiate debating.<br><br>Avoiding jargon and complex theory discussions, The Debater's Guide offers sound advice on presenting an effective case in oral discourse, helps students build their understanding of how and why debate functions, and provides a solid foundation for success in any format. The expanded contents pages and new subheadings allow for quick reference to any particular aspect of debate, making this new edition an excellent choice for classroom use as well as a valuable hands-on tool during debates.</p><p><b>James J.

For the authors of <i>Lobbying and Policy Change</i>, the most extensive study ever done on the topic, these promises ring hollow&#x2014;not because politicians fail to keep them but because lobbies are far less influential than political rhetoric suggests.<br> <br> Based on a comprehensive examination of ninety-eight issues, this volume demonstrates that sixty percent of recent lobbying campaigns failed to change policy despite millions of dollars spent trying. Why? The authors find that resources explain less than five percent of the difference between successful and unsuccessful efforts. Moreover, they show, these attempts must overcome an entrenched Washington system with a tremendous bias in favor of the status quo.<br> <br> Though elected officials and existing policies carry more weight, lobbies have an impact too, and when advocates for a given issue finally succeed, policy tends to change significantly. The authors argue, however, that the lobbying community so strongly reflects elite interests that it will not fundamentally alter the balance of power unless its makeup shifts dramatically in favor of average Americans&#x2019; concerns.</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><p><b>Frank R.

An elaborately detailed, darkly surprising, definitive history of the LA gangsta rap era."---<em>Kirkus</em>, starred review<br><br>A monumental, revealing narrative history about the legendary group of artists at the forefront of West Coast hip-hop: Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac Shakur.</strong><br><br>Amid rising gang violence, the crack epidemic, and police brutality, a group of unlikely voices cut through the chaos of late 1980s Los Angeles: N.W.A. Led by a drug dealer, a glammed-up producer, and a high school kid, N.W.A gave voice to disenfranchised African Americans across the country. And they quickly redefined pop culture across the world. Their names remain as popular as ever--Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube. Dre soon joined forces with Suge Knight to create the combustible Death Row Records, which in turn transformed Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur into superstars.<br><br>Ben Westhoff explores how this group of artists shifted the balance of hip-hop from New York to Los Angeles. He shows how N.W.A.'s shocking success lead to rivalries between members, record labels, and eventually a war between East Coast and West Coast factions. In the process, hip-hop burst into mainstream America at a time of immense social change, and became the most dominant musical movement of the last thirty years. At gangsta rap's peak, two of its biggest names--Tupac and Biggie Smalls--were murdered, leaving the surviving artists to forge peace before the genre annihilated itself. <br><br>Featuring extensive investigative reporting, interviews with the principal players, and dozens of never-before-told stories, <em>Original Gangstas</em> is a groundbreaking addition to the history of popular music.<br></p><p><b>Ben Westhoff</b><b>&nbsp;</b>is an award-winning journalist and former<i> L.A.

To reconstruct the Jesus who provoked this punishment, Fredriksen takes us into the religious worlds, Jewish and pagan, of Mediterranean antiquity, through the labyrinth of Galilean and Judean politics, and on into the ancient narratives of Paul's letters, the gospels, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and Josephus' histories. The result is a profound contribution both to our understanding of the social and religious contexts within which Jesus of Nazareth moved, and to our appreciation of the mission and message that ended in the proclamation of Jesus as Messiah.</p><p>The epigraph to <i>Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews</i> by Paula Fredriksen includes the following observation by Matteo Ricci: "[A]ll things (including those that at last come to triumph mightily) are at their beginnings so small and faint in outline that one cannot easily convince oneself that from them will grow matters of great moment." This little thought helps to explain Fredriksen's big one, that no one during Jesus' lifetime (including the man himself) considered Jesus to be the Messiah. That interpretation of his life, Fredriksen argues, was occasioned by his death: "Jesus' crucifixion as King of the Jews had come as a shock to his core followers. Their experiences of his continued presence after his death, on the evidence of the Gospels, surprised them, too. Seeking to understand what they had witnessed, they turned to Scripture." <i>Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews</i> makes its argument through careful reconstruction of Jesus' historical context, and dogged attention to the details of his crucifixion and to the fates of his immediate followers. The book's surprising arguments and its lucid style make this a valuable addition to the canon of popular Historical Jesus scholarship. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"A captivating, plausible, but surely controversial interpretation of Jesus, and particularly of his death...that departs dramatically from tradition." <br> --<i>Boston Globe</i><br><p>"An important contribution."<br> --<i> Booklist</i><br></p><p>"Why was Jesus killed?...Fredriksen's search for an answer is almost a detective story...refreshingly independent of dogma and cant."<br> -- <i>Atlanta Journal Constitution</i><br></p><p>"A marvelous book...Fredriksen's exercises in historical investigation are riveting."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- <i>Bostonia</i></p></p><h2>The Lost Art of Towel Origami</h2><p>I used to have an origami business, but it folded."<br><br>From the lost ancient art of towel folding (yes, there is one, and it does stem from ancient times) comes the newly revived and hot trend <i>The Lost Art of Towel Origami.</i><br> <br>Filled with hilarious completed-project photographs and step-by-step instructions and illustrations, this book will provide hours of entertainment.

It is the story of a powerful, privileged American man who was able to treat a woman's life as disposable without facing real consequences. And it is the story of a shameful political coverup involving one of the nation's most well-connected families and its network of lawyers, public relations people, and friends who ensured Ted Kennedy remained a respected member of the Senate for forty more years.<br> <br> Originally published in 1988 under the title&nbsp;<i>Senatorial Privilege</i>, this book almost didn't make it into print after its original publisher, Random House, judged it too explosive and backed out of its contract with author Leo Damore.

Little is known about the Vedic people, who lived more than three thousand years ago in northern India: They left behind almost no objects, images, or ruins. They created no empires. Even the <i>soma</i>, the likely hallucinogenic plant that appears at the center of some of their rituals, has not been identified with any certainty. Only a "Parthenon of words" remains: verses and formulations suggesting a daring understanding of life.</p><p>"If the Vedic people had been asked why they did not build cities," writes Calasso, "they could have replied: we did not seek power, but <i>rapture</i>."

Writing with an incomparable knowledge of his subject but without a hint of pedantry, Van Doren elucidates both the astonishing boldness and myriad subtleties of Shakespeare's protean art. His <i>Shakespeare</i> is a book to be treasured by both new and longtime students of the Bard.</p><p><b>Mark Van Doren</b> (1894-1972) was born in Hope, Illinois, and received his A.M. and Ph.D. from Columbia, where he taught literature for nearly forty years and where his students included Thomas Merton, John Berryman, and Allen Ginsberg.

When it came time for Ruthie to go to school, Jessica went with her. Her parents hoped Ruthie would find a friend at school who would replace Jessica. They were in for a (happy) surprise!</p></p><p>Much to her parents' chagrin, 5-year-old Ruthie has a devoted invisible friend named Jessica. When Ruthie accidentally spills juice, Jessica gladly takes the blame. When Ruthie's parents plan to hire a baby sitter and go to a movie, Jessica gets a tummy ache and needs them to stay home. "There is no Jessica," her parents keep insisting. "But Ruthie knew there was," the author keeps repeating. Kevin Henkes's Popsicle-colored watercolors and detailed pen-and-ink drawings invite us into Ruthie and Jessica's fantasy world. Through his handwritten cartoon dialogue, we are privy to their tender conversations and confidences. When it's time to start kindergarten, Ruthie's father suggests that Jessica stay home. But of course Ruthie brings Jessica anyway. On that fateful day we discover what Ruthie knew all along--there really is a Jessica! Children who believe in imaginary playmates will find their soul mate in Ruthie. And parents who fret over the isolation of an absorbing imaginary life will find comfort in the story's happy ending. All families will appreciate the twists of fate that allow a child's fantasy world to joyfully overlap into the real one. <i>School Library Journal</i> Best Book of the Year, <i>Horn Book</i> Fanfare Honor List, IRA/CBC Children's Choice, <i>American Bookseller</i> Pick of the Lists.

"One of the most absorbing books I have read in recent years" (Joseph Wood Krutch, The Nation). Index.<br></p><p>In this landmark book the impulse toward self-destructiveness is examined as a misdirection of the instinct for survival, a turning inward of the aggressive behavior developed for self-preservation. The self-imposed illness, despair, even suicide, that result from this conflict are compassionately yet objectively analyzed and documented through case histories. Drawing on the work of such pioneers as Ferenczi, Groddeck, Jelliffe, White, Alexander, and Simmel, Menninger shows that intelligent self-knowledge can bring self-respect and understanding into man&#39;s psychological war against himself--on the side of self-preservation.Karl Augustus Menninger (July 22, 1893 - July 18, 1990), born in Topeka, Kansas, was an American psychiatrist and a member of the famous Menninger family of psychiatrists who founded the Menninger Foundation and the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas.<br><br><p></p> <p>During his career, Menninger wrote a number of influential books. In his first book, <i>The Human Mind</i>, Menninger argued that psychiatry was a science and that the mentally ill were only slightly different than healthy individuals. In <i>The Crime of Punishment</i>, Menninger argued that crime was preventable through psychiatric treatment; punishment was a brutal and inefficient relic of the past. He advocated treating offenders like the mentally ill.<br><br></p> <p>His subsequent books include <i>The Vital Balance</i>, <i>Man Against Himself</i> and <i>Love Against Hate</i>.</p></p><h2>Veil of Night: A Novel</h2><p><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER<br><br><b>In this thrilling novel of romantic suspense, Linda Howard cordially invites us to an elaborate wedding&#x2014;one in which rings will never be exchanged, kisses will never be shared, and the bride will never see the light of day, because a killer has been waiting under a <br> &nbsp;<br> VEIL OF NIGHT<br> &nbsp;</b><br> Jaclyn Wilde is a wedding planner who loves her job&#x2014;usually. But helping Carrie Edwards with her Big Day has been an unrelenting nightmare. Carrie is a bridezilla of mythic nastiness, yet the unpleasant task at hand turns seriously criminal when Carrie is brutally murdered and everyone involved with the ceremony is accusing one another of doing the deed. Assigned to the case, Detective Eric Wilder finds that there&#x2019;s too much evidence pointing toward too many suspects. Compounding his problems is Jaclyn, now a prime suspect, with whom he shared one deeply passionate night before Carrie&#x2019;s death. As the heat intensifies between Eric and Jaclyn, a cold-blooded murderer moves dangerously close. And this time the target is not a bride but one particularly irresistible wedding planner, unaware of a killer&#x2019;s vow.<br></p><p><b>Linda Howard</b> is the award-winning author of many <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>Ice, Burn, Death Angel, Up Close and Dangerous, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Cover of Night, Killing Time, To Die For, Kiss Me While I Sleep, Cry No More, Dying to Please, Open Season, Mr. Perfect, All the Queen&#x2019;s Men, Now You See Her, Kill and Tell, </i>and <i>Son of the Morning</i>, and co-author (with Linda Jones) of<i> Blood Born</i>. She lives in Alabama with her husband and a golden retriever.Chapter One<br><br>Six weddings in five days. <i>Holy shit.</i><br><br>All Jaclyn Wilde could think was that her mother, Madelyn, who was her partner in Premier, <i>the</i> events planning firm to hire in the greater Atlanta area if you wanted your guests to be impressed, must have been sipping a couple or twelve champagne martinis when she&#x2019;d accepted so many bookings so close together. It wouldn&#x2019;t have been nearly as bad if the bookings had been anything other than weddings: a party was simple in comparison to a wedding, because they were relatively free of emotional turmoil. A wedding, on the other hand, was fraught with every emotion known to man. It wasn&#x2019;t just the brides; it was the bride&#x2019;s mother, the groom&#x2019;s mother, the maid of honor, the bridesmaids, the parents of the flower girl and the ring bearer, the cousins who weren&#x2019;t invited to be in the wedding party, what colors to choose, the date, the location, the damn <i>font</i> on the friggin&#x2019; invitations . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Jaclyn Wilde,&#x201d; the clerk called, interrupting Jaclyn&#x2019;s increasingly stressed and frantic thoughts.<br><br>The clerk&#x2019;s voice was too cheerful. Didn&#x2019;t she realize it was inappropriate to sound cheerful when you were collecting payments for traffic violations? Maybe it was asking too much that she sound glum, but she could at least sound bored and noncom?mittal, instead of all but dancing with glee at taking someone&#x2019;s money.<br><br>Jaclyn stifled her irritation; it stemmed more from the almost impossible workload facing her during the coming week than it did from paying her speeding ticket. Adding to her stress was the fact that <i>because</i> they&#x2019;d been working so hard, she&#x2019;d forgotten to mail in the money for the speeding ticket, and today was the day it was due, so she&#x2019;d either had to take time off from work&#x2014;thereby increasing the stress by getting behind&#x2014;or have a warrant issued for her arrest. Yeah, that would be a real stress-reducer.<br><br>Being late was her fault. If the city of Hopewell, where she lived and where she&#x2019;d received the ticket, had been set up to receive online payments, she could have handled it that way, but it wasn&#x2019;t. She got up, silently forked over the cash, and a minute later was striding down the hall, the speeding ticket already forgotten because that particular item had just been checked off her to-do list.<br><br>She glanced down at her watch. She had just enough time to get to her next appointment&#x2014;Carrie Edwards, a bitch for all seasons, and one of the reasons why six weddings in five days was looming as Mission Impossible. Carrie&#x2019;s wedding wasn&#x2019;t even one of the six; her wedding wasn&#x2019;t for another month, but Carrie was taking up way too much of their time with her histrionics and constant flip-flopping on decisions. One bridesmaid had already told her&#x2014;Carrie, not Jaclyn&#x2014;to go fuck herself, which was a first in ?Jac?lyn&#x2019;s experience. Usually, no matter what the bride did, the members of the wedding party would grit their teeth and see it through. Even when they did drop out, they&#x2019;d make polite excuses. Not this girl; she&#x2019;d let Carrie have it with both barrels, and hadn&#x2019;t minced words.<br><br>When the blow-up happened, Jaclyn had stepped out of sight, allowed herself a wide smile and a fist pump, then schooled her expression and returned to try to forestall a hair-pulling, eye-gouging cat fight. She&#x2019;d have loved to see Carrie with a black eye, but business was business.<br><br>If she hadn&#x2019;t been so wrapped up in her thoughts she might have been faster on her feet, but when a door suddenly swung outward she was caught by surprise and slammed into the tall, dark-haired, dark-suited man who stepped into the corridor. She gave a short, sharp &#x201c;Oomph!&#x201d; The impact knocked her briefcase from her hand and sent it spinning across the gray-tiled floor. She felt one foot, elegantly shod in three-inch heels, begin to slip, and in panic instinctively grabbed the man&#x2019;s arm to steady herself. Her free arm slipped inside his open jacket and she grabbed a handful of shirt fabric, holding on for dear life. The side of her arm brushed against something very hard, and there was a very brief glimpse of leather before she made the startled identification of <i>holster</i>, followed by <i>gun</i>, then <i>cop</i>. Considering she was in city hall, the conclusion was both logical and inescapable.<br><br>The arm she grabbed turned to iron as the man immediately tensed it to hold her weight; he half-turned, his other arm sliding around her waist to catch her. For a brief moment, no more than the second needed for her to catch her balance, she was held firmly against a very warm, very solid, indisputably male body.<br><br>He released her the moment she was sure-footed, but he didn&#x2019;t back away. Not immediately, anyway. She blew out a shaky breath. &#x201c;Wow. Whew.&#x201d; Her heartbeat, thrown into high gear thanks to the collision and almost falling, was pounding against her rib cage so hard she could feel the thuds. A spill on the floor of city hall would&#x2019;ve been par for the course on this perfectly crappy day, but the last thing she needed right now was to break an ankle or something. Even a sprained ankle, at this point, would throw Premier into a time-crunch they simply wouldn&#x2019;t be able to handle.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you all right, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d;<br><br>He bent his head down as he spoke and his breath, scented with spearmint chewing gum, brushed her temple. His voice was a warm baritone, with a slight rasp that roughened it just enough to take the tone from mellow to something . . . more. She didn&#x2019;t know just what that <i>more</i> was, just that it was there&#x2014; Wait a minute. Had he just called her <i>ma&#x2019;am</i>?<br><br>Did she look <i>that</i> haggard?<br><br>Jaclyn squashed her initial annoyed reaction. The badge he wore explained the &#x201c;ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Actually, being almost anywhere in the South explained it. He wasn&#x2019;t commenting on her appearance; he was a cop, a civil servant on his best behavior. She blew out another breath, and realized she hadn&#x2019;t yet released her grip on either his arm or his shirt. He <i>couldn&#x2019;t </i>step back, not as long as she clung to him. She forced her fingers to unclench from both shirt and arm, and she took the necessary step back to put some distance between them.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; she said as she looked up at him. &#x201c;Thanks for catching me. I wasn&#x2019;t paying attention to where I was going.&#x201d; A small part of her brain, the part reserved for hormones and irrational decisions, gave a wolf whistle. Abruptly she felt both over-heated and overexcited. Damn, he was fine-looking, in a way that wasn&#x2019;t at all boyish and depended more on strength and an air of competency than it did on regular features. There were boys, and there were men. This was a <i>man</i>. This was a man who had <i>it,</i> that indefinable quality of sex appeal, maturity, and strength all mingled together into a potent whole.<br><br>He gave a slight smile, a nice and natural, easy curve of his lips. &#x201c;Not the best layout here, as far as traffic goes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mention <i>traffic</i> to me,&#x201d; Jaclyn said, almost under her breath.<br><br>He shot a quick glance of comprehension in the direction from which she&#x2019;d come, and his smile widened a little. She liked that smile more than she should.<br><br>In her line of business, Jaclyn met a lot of men; unfortunately, they were usually about to get married. Not always, of course, but it took something special to get her attention this way: a certain look, an unexpected chemistry . . . and to be honest, it had been a very long time since she&#x2019;d had the time to admire any man.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t have time now, either. She had to really hurry, or she&#x2019;d be late.<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks again. Sorry I almost smashed you flat.&#x201d; She gave the polite cop a quick nod of her head, a friendly&#x2014;but not <i>too</i> friendly&#x2014;good-bye, then looked around for her dropped briefcase.<br><br>The case had spun all the way across the wide hall, coming to a stop against the far wall. Before she could reach for it, a man in stained jeans and a dingy T-shirt stretched tight over an enormous beer belly laboriously bent down and picked up the case. &#x201c;Here ya go, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; he said, holding the slender case out to her in one meaty paw and smiling a ridiculously sweet smile for such a rough face.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Jaclyn said as she gripped the handle, giving the burly guy a warmer smile than she&#x2019;d given the cop, because she wasn&#x2019;t attracted to him at all, so being nice to him didn&#x2019;t seem as dangerous as being nice to the cop. As she strode away down the hall she mused on how cock-eyed that reasoning was, on a logical basis, but how rock solid it was on some gut-level feminine instinct. She didn&#x2019;t have time for the cop, didn&#x2019;t have time to be attracted to him, so she wasn&#x2019;t about to do anything that might attract him.<br><br>As she walked away, she was almost certain that he was watching her, but she didn&#x2019;t dare turn around to look. She didn&#x2019;t <i>need</i> to turn around; she could practically feel the bull&#x2019;s-eye his gaze was painting on her back.<br><br>She hurried out to the parking lot, using her remote to unlock her steel-gray Jaguar just before she reached it. In almost one motion she opened the door, tossed her briefcase onto the passenger seat, and slid behind the wheel. Her first action then was to hit the door lock, a safety precaution she&#x2019;d taken so often it was second nature to her now. As she turned the key with one hand, she was pulling the seat belt into place with the other.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t need another ticket, so she kept an eye on the speedometer. She especially wasn&#x2019;t going to speed on the way to a meeting with Carrie Edwards; it was all she could do to keep the car heading in the right direction, and even then she flirted with the idea of calling her mother and saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m throwing up, have hives, and probably the measles; can you handle my meeting with Carrie?&#x201d; So what if Madelyn was occupied with getting the final details in place for a wedding tomorrow, and had the rehearsal to get through? Madelyn was the one who had taken Carrie&#x2019;s booking in the first place, so it was only right she should share some of the joy of dealing with her.<br><br>Jaclyn sighed. No, she couldn&#x2019;t do that to her mother. Well, maybe she couldn&#x2019;t. She certainly wasn&#x2019;t in a hurry to meet with Carrie, who was the worst of the worst in a business that often seemed to bring out <i>the</i> worst in some women. Sometimes a client would be a delight from start to finish, but just as often one of the principals would make her think there really was something to be said for getting married at a courthouse or an all-night chapel in Vegas&#x2014;not that she&#x2019;d be foolish enough to say so aloud. After all, weddings were her bread and butter.</p><h2>Usborne Illustrated Fairy Tales (Anthologies &amp; Treasuries) (Illustrated Stories)</h2><p>This item condition is New.

He contributes regularly to London Review of Books, the Guardian, and the New York Review of Books.This lucid guide is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand leaders such as Trump and Chavez * Guardian * An excellent short book -- Timothy Garton Ash * New York Review of Books * In this essential book, Muller defines populism&#39;s most salient characteristics --antielitism, antipluralism, exclusivity -- and explains Trump and other populists through that framework. It is a quick read, and worth every page * Washington Post * Populism is not just antiliberal, it is antidemocratic -- the permanent shadow of representative politics. That&#39;s Jan-Werner Muller&#39;s argument in this brilliant book. There is no better guide to the populist passions of the present -- Ivan Krastev, author of After Europe No one has written more insightfully and knowledgeably about Europe&#39;s recent democratic decay than Jan-Werner Muller. His depiction of populism as democracy&#39;s antipluralist, moralistic shadow is masterful -- Dani Rodrik, Harvard University An exceptionally intelligent book about a notoriously slippery, yet essential, political concept.

The three-hundred-and-fifty-year-old Rustico sat perched on a hill in the verdant Spoleto valley amid an olive grove and fruit trees of every kind. For the Tuckers, it was literally love at first sight, and the couple purchased the house without testing the water pressure or checking for signs of termites. Shedding the vestiges of their American life, Michael and Jill endeavored to learn the language, understand the nuances of Italian culture, and build a home in this new chapter of their lives. Both a celebration of a good marriage and a careful study of the nature of home, <i>Living in a Foreign Language</i> is a gorgeous, organic travelogue written with an epicurean&#x2019;s delight in detail and a gourmand&#x2019;s appreciation for all things fine.</p><p>A satisfying look into the good life.&#x201d; Publisher&#x2019;s Weekly<br><br> Foodies will slaver and bristle with envy at the surfeit of pungently fresh truffles that appear at seemingly every meal.&#x201d;�� Mark Knoblauch, Boolist<br><br> Not at all the usual actor&#x2019;s memoir, but a simple toast to eating, drinking and innocent merriment in old Umbria.&#x201d; Kirkus Reviews<br><br> If you&#x2019;ve ever dreamed of living in an ancient stone villa set high above the Italian countryside and who hasn&#x2019;t?

From New York to Los Angeles to Marin county to Italy and New York again, it&#x2019;s an odyssey of change and growth filled with good wine, fine food, and great friends. Infused with love, the Tuckers&#x2019; saga of building a home (and a life) in Umbria, Italy, is as warm and irresistible as a freshly baked pizza.&#x201d; Steven Bocho, hollywood producer and creator of L.A.

Without knowledge of the wines&#x2019; accompanying food, you&#x2019;re nothing but a wine geek. Books like Living in a Foreign Language provide such an ideal context for how to truly enjoy wine with food that they should be required reading for all oenophiles.&#x201d; The Washington Post<br><br> One quarter of the way through I realized this wonderful experience of Italy was going to have a last page, which I couldn&#x2019;t and didn&#x2019;t want to happen. I devoured each moment!&#x201d; Bernadette Peters<br><br> Michael Tucker&#x2019;s life is full of adventurous, lusty choices. He writes about them with just as much boldness. Whether it&#x2019;s an Italian lesson in Rome or the first pizza party in his four-hundredyear- old kitchen in Umbria, his descriptions make you feel as if you&#x2019;re guests in his home.&#x201d; John Lithgow<br><br> When actor/writer Tucker and his wife, actress Jill Eikenberry, bought a cottage in Umbria, they fell in love with the house, the place, the food, the wine, and each other all over again. This charming memoir will make you want to hop on the next plane to Italy with the love of your life (or find the love of your life).&#x201d; Elisabeth Grant-Gibson, Windows a bookshop, Monroe, LA, Book Sense quote<br><br>In this lighthearted memoir by television's former <i>L.A. Law</i> star, Tucker delve graciously into the rich lifestyle, cuisine and local wine of central Italy when he and his wife, actress Jill Eikenberry, make an impromptu purchase of a 350-year-old stone cottage in the Umbrian countryside. The Tuckers break away from the Bay Area to acquaint themselves with the Rustico, their new second home. Despite speaking limited Italian, they quickly befriend their expatriate and Italian neighbors and with them set out to celebrate the regional cuisine found in local trattorias, tavernas and the aromatic kitchens of new acquaintances. Language gaffes and the occasional couple's spat is to be expected, as the Tuckers begin to re-evaluate their lives. The simplicity and heartiness of Umbria begins to feel more like home for them, and little by little the Tuckers let go of their more career-ambitious lives in the U.S. Jill's revitalization of her theater career in New York becomes as much of an accomplishment as her taking art classes with 16 non-English-speaking Italian housewives. Tucker simply appreciates his relationships forged with Gloria, the owner of the local <i>orta-frutta</i> shop and the town's butchers. Guileless narrative intertwined with generous descriptions of Italian fare make Tucker's food memoir and travelogue a satisfying look into the good life. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was five a.m., according to the clock on my side of the bed. But the only light in the room was a dim nightlight and my husband and I had both been sound asleep. To me, that qualifies as night.<br><br> The phone is on McQuaid's side of the bed, so he was the one who groped for it, found it on the fourth ring, and growled, "Who the hell is this and whaddya want?"<br><br> My sentiments exactly, although I admit to lying very still, stiff with apprehension, conducting a mental inventory of the people I love while McQuaid listened to the voice on the other end of the line. Caitie, our daughter, was asleep down the hall, but our son, Brian, is a student at UT Austin. He's not the kind of kid who gets into trouble, but accidents do happen. Not to mention that my mother's husband, Sam, has a history of heart problems, and that my mother-Leatha-is no spring chicken. And Mom and Dad McQuaid are both nearly eighty and-<br><br> "Aw, hell," McQuaid said, drawing out the word, profoundly regretful. "He's dead?"<br><br> Dead. I pulled in a breath and held it, squeezing my eyes shut. "Who?" I whispered. Who was he? Brian? Sam? Dad McQuaid?<br><br> McQuaid pushed himself into a sitting position, pulling the pillow behind his head. "So where did this thing go down?" His voice was tense, urgent. "Yeah. Southwest Houston, right? Bellaire?"<br><br> Southwest Houston. I relaxed a little. Sam was at home at their ranch in South Texas-I'd talked to my mother just the night before. McQuaid's dad didn't drive, and anyway, he and Mom McQuaid were home, too, in Seguin, east of San Antonio. Which left Brian-but he was in Austin.<br><br> I caught my lower lip between my teeth. I thought Brian was in Austin. He was between terms, working part-time at The Natural Gardener, out on Bee Cave Road. He hadn't mentioned going out of town. But kids are kids. He and some friends might have decided to drive to Houston on a lark and he'd forgotten to let us know.<br><br> "Who?" I asked, louder now. I propped myself up on one elbow and put a hand on McQuaid's bare forearm. The room was dark, but the glow-in-the-dark clock cast a faint green shadow over his face. "Who's dead? What's going on, McQuaid?"<br><br> McQuaid looked down at me and shook his head with a brisk don't-interrupt-me-now frown-his cop frown. No, his ex-cop frown. I flopped back on my pillow. I didn't think he was talking about Brian. And if it wasn't about family, it must be about work. My husband is a part-time private eye, and PIs don't punch a clock. He's been known to work twenty-four-hour shifts, catch a couple of hours of sleep, and do it all over again. Still, he doesn't usually get calls at this hour of the night. I squinted at the clock again and groaned. Morning. At this hour of the morning.<br><br> McQuaid was shaking his head as if he didn't quite believe what he was hearing. "How in the hell did he manage that? Death Row is tight." He listened a moment more, then spat out, "Damn it, Jessie, if they can't keep a better handle on their prisoners, maybe they deserve to lose a few."<br><br> Ah. There had been a prison break. And Jessie had to be Jess Branson, one of McQuaid's cop buddies from his days as a detective in Houston Homicide. But that still left the question of why Jessie was calling our house at the unholy hour of five a.m. about a prison break. McQuaid no longer wore a badge. If a prisoner or two had escaped, tough titty. Somebody else was dealing with it. I closed my eyes. So go away, Jess. Get some coffee, get a doughnut, get off the phone.<br><br> "It doesn't sound good," McQuaid was saying grimly. "Okay, you guys work it at your end, and I'll get on it here." He leaned over to peer at the clock. "Hell, no, not now, Jess. It's not even six yet. Nothing's going to happen in the next hour, man. Max may be a freakin' genius, but he hasn't learned to fly. So far as I know, anyway."<br><br> Max. I frowned. He had to be talking about Max Mantel. Bad Max Mantel. McQuaid had been the lead detective on the team that tracked him down and arrested him. Mantel had been charged with killing two teenage girls who were trying to blow the whistle on his sex trafficking ring. McQuaid had once said that Bad Max was one of the smartest criminals he had ever put away, which was why the man had managed to keep his slimy slave trade hidden under the rocks for so long.<br><br> That had been ten or twelve years ago. McQuaid and I had been dating then, and I had listened to his take on the prosecution's case with a great deal of interest. While it is true that there is nothing in the law that I detest more than the death penalty, it is also true that every now and then there's a case-and a criminal-that causes me to think twice about my objections. Bad Max was one of them. I've never blamed McQuaid for saying-and only half joking-that it was too bad he hadn't pulled the trigger when he had Mantel in his gunsight and saved the state the cost of an execution.<br><br> Anyway, I was rooting for the prosecution, which had been deftly handled by smart-mouthed assistant district attorney Paul Watkins, whom I had also dated once upon a faraway time. Paul was a flamboyant showoff who loved being the center of attention. But he had the better case, hands down, and the jury did just what he asked them to do. They sent Bad Max to Huntsville. To Death Row.<br><br> My eyes popped open.<br><br> Max Mantel had escaped? But Huntsville was a maximum-security prison. Nobody had gotten out of there since 1998, when a Death Row inmate cut through a fence, scaled a roof, and went over the top of two security fences, clad in a clumsy suit of cardboard body armor to protect him from the razor wire. Finding the guy took a full week, five hundred officers, and a half-dozen tracking dogs, assisted by four cop choppers equipped with heat sensors. No doubt a similar team would be assembled and sent out to recapture Bad Max. But McQuaid was no longer on the payroll. I didn't see what any of this had to do with him, especially at this hour.<br><br> I slid down and pulled the sheet over my head. Maybe I could manage a few more minutes of sleep before I had to get up and pack. Today was Friday, and Ruby and I were driving to the Last Chance Olive Ranch, where we were leading a workshop on Saturday afternoon. Ruby had been trying for months to get me out to the ranch, which is owned by her friend Maddie Haskell. She had even suggested that we tack on a couple of extra days-Sunday and Monday-for a little R and R. I was glad to agree. The month of May had been busy at the shops, and I was looking forward to the quiet pleasures of a long weekend. But I wasn't going to get any more shut-eye.<br><br> "Okay. I'll do that." McQuaid's voice was clipped. "In the meantime, you'd better call Carl Zumwalt. He's retired now, but he was the other lead on the Mantel investigation. He's still living in the Houston area-Pearland, I think. If Max is the one who took Watkins out, he might go for Carl next. Tell him to watch his back."<br><br> I flapped the sheet down and propped myself on my elbows. "Took Watkins out? Paul Watkins?" I sucked in a breath, hardly believing what I'd heard. "Mantel went after the district attorney?"<br><br> Because Paul Watkins, the larger-than-life prosecutor who had sent Mantel to Death Row, had gotten a career boost out of the case. He was now the Big Cheese he had always wanted to be: Harris County district attorney. I'd been hearing from people who knew him that he'd be the next candidate for Texas attorney general. After that, maybe governor.<br><br> McQuaid gave me a surprised look, as if he'd forgotten I was there. "Sure, Jessie," he said into the phone. "Listen, I can't get into it now. Thanks for the heads-up. I'll give you a call in a couple of hours." He hung up and switched on the small bedside light. "Mantel got out of Huntsville night before last. They're still trying to figure out how he did it-must've had inside help. The dogs went out, but they lost him at the highway. He probably had outside help, too. An accomplice waiting with a car. They're not sure where-"<br><br> "Wait a minute." I was still trying to get my mind around what I thought I'd heard. "Max Mantel killed Paul Watkins?" Paul-bigger than life and twice as vigorous-was dead?<br><br> McQuaid rubbed a hand across the dark morning stubble on his jaw. "They don't know for sure it was Mantel, China. But one of the Huntsville snitches reported that he'd been threatening to kill everybody associated with his conviction." He slanted me a quick look, and I knew he had said more than he intended. He cleared his throat and added hastily, "Somebody was waiting when Watkins and . . . When Watkins got home late last night from a party. Shot him. Jess says his team is still processing the scene."<br><br> I was still grappling with the terrible news about Paul, but I snatched at what McQuaid had just said. "Kill everybody associated with his conviction? That means-"<br><br> "Big talk," McQuaid said firmly. "You know how these cons are, China. They like to blow hot air. Mantel is probably in Mexico by now. And Watkins has put away more than his share of criminals since he's been in the DA's office. Any one of a couple of dozen would have been glad to pull that trigger."<br><br> He was right about that. Paul had been in the justice business for a long time. Anybody he'd ever prosecuted, any gang he'd gone after-they could all have him on their hit lists.<br><br> "Didn't have to be Mantel," McQuaid added firmly. "Probably wasn't, in fact."<br><br> As if that settled everything. As if I should just slide down under the covers and go back to sleep.<br><br> "But it could have been Mantel." The goose bumps were prickling across my shoulders and I could taste the sour fear at the back of my throat. I was remembering the awful night when McQuaid took a bullet in the neck and I thought he was going to die. Cops die, yes, every day. You never think it's going to happen to your cop, until it does, until he doesn't come home, never comes home again.<br><br> I swallowed hard. "Jess was calling to warn you, wasn't he? And you told him to warn Carl Zumwalt, too. You think Mantel is going to-"<br><br> I broke off, thinking that it really might have been better if McQuaid had taken Mantel out when he had the chance. Paul would still be alive right now, and McQuaid wouldn't be in danger.<br><br> "Hey." McQuaid swung toward me, his weight on one elbow, one eyebrow quirked. He touched my lips with his finger. "Don't sweat it, babe. I've been threatened by crooks who are a damn sight meaner than Mantel. I'm a big guy, you know. I can take care of myself." Eyes light, he bent over me, humorous, confident, macho. "Hey. I can take care of you, too."<br><br> I knew he was trying to reassure me. I also knew that he was about to use sex to distract me-which usually works because I am easily distracted by the prospect of sex with my husband. I pushed the fear down deep inside of me and brushed the dark hair off his forehead.<br><br> "Oh, yeah?" I was willing to go along, to play his game. It might make both of us feel better. It might make me forget that Paul-so full of life, with so much to live for-was dead and that the man who killed him might be coming to kill my husband. "You think so, do you, big fella?"<br><br> "I know so," he whispered, and put his hand on my breast. "Just watch me."<br><br> And for the next little while, we did what two people do when they're in bed and fully awake and it's not quite time to get up and face the world.<br><br> It was a lovely few moments. But I wasn't distracted.<br><br> And I could still taste the fear.<br><br> Chapter Two<br><br> Out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety.<br><br> William Shakespeare Henry IV, Part I<br><br> The early-morning phone call prompted a change in the weekend plans.<br><br> Originally, we had planned that Caitie would stay home with McQuaid while Ruby and I spent Friday through Monday at the ranch. But Jess's unsettling call had given me some serious second thoughts. It would be a major inconvenience for Maddie Haskell-the ranch owner-if I canceled the Saturday workshop. It would be costly for her, too, since the workshop was sold out. She'd have to refund everybody's money and send them home, or reschedule, or try to find a replacement.<br><br> But as I got dressed and went downstairs to make breakfast-quietly, because Caitie was still asleep-I was remembering that Mantel, now on the loose, had been convicted of killing two teenage girls. I ought to cancel the workshop. I ought to stay home and keep an eye on Caitie, who owns a large chunk of my heart. And be close to my husband, in case . . . well, in case Mantel showed up. In case something happened.<br><br> In the kitchen, I was greeted by Winchester, the three-year-old basset we adopted at Basset Rescue a couple of months before. Winchester (like our beloved Howard Cosell, departed but fondly remembered) is lengthy and low-slung, with floppy brown ears, saggy jowls, a tendency to drool, and a remarkably doleful air. Clearly, his previous life brimmed with calamities and catastrophes, and he's not fully persuaded that his present life is an improvement-especially because he hasn't yet been allowed to spend the evening in McQuaid's leather recliner, or claim the entire foot of our bed, or get away with stealing bagels. But when I put his breakfast kibbles into his bowl, he clambered out of his basset basket and gave me a look of polite appreciation before he dug into it. Winchester may be a bagel thief, but he is a gentleman, through and through.</p><h2>MatchUp</h2><p>This &#x201c;highly recommended&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review) collection edited by <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Lee Child pairs the beloved characters of twenty-two internationally bestselling writers in &#x201c;a must-read for fans of the thriller genre.

In 1972, Baby X grows up without a gender and is happy about it.<br>Rather than teaching children to obey authority, to conform, or to seek redemption through prayer, twentieth-century leftists encouraged children to question the authority of those in power. Tales for Little Rebels collects forty-three mostly out-of-print stories, poems, comic strips, primers, and other texts for children that embody this radical tradition. These pieces reflect the concerns of twentieth-century leftist movements, like peace, civil rights, gender equality, environmental responsibility, and the dignity of labor. They also address the means of achieving these ideals, including taking collective action, developing critical thinking skills, and harnessing the liberating power of the imagination.<br>Some of the authors and illustrators are familiar, including Lucille Clifton, Syd Hoff, Langston Hughes, Walt Kelly, Norma Klein, Munro Leaf, Julius Lester, Eve Merriam, Charlotte Pomerantz, Carl Sandburg, and Dr. Seuss. Others are relatively unknown today, but their work deserves to be remembered. (Each of the pieces includes an introduction and a biographical sketch of the author.) From the anti-advertising message of Johnny Get Your Money&#x2019;s Worth (and Jane Too)! (1938) to the entertaining lessons in ecology provided by The Day They Parachuted Cats on Borneo (1971), and Sandburg&#x2019;s mockery of war in Rootabaga Pigeons (1923), these pieces will thrill readers intrigued by politics and history&#x2014;and anyone with a love of children&#x2019;s literature, no matter what age.</p></p><p><b>Julia L.

A.R. 2004 ALA Notable Recording � AudioFile 2004, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Photographs of Abraham Lincoln</h2><p>First published in 1911, <i>The Photographs of Abraham Lincoln</i> was privately printed by Frederick Hill Meserve, the preeminent historian of the photographs of Abraham Lincoln. It was a groundbreaking look at the then-known photographs of the sixteenth president of the United States, who was the first president to be photographed while in office. In the decades that followed, Meserve made new discoveries and updated the information that was known about each image. He published an expanded edition in 1944, collaborating with the Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg. This new work, published on the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's death, is an update to Meserve's original biographical documentation, and includes 114 portraits. Here we see Lincoln's striking face, photographed over a span of 20 years (1846&#x2013;65). Published with the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation, this new iteration of <i>The Photographs of Abraham Lincoln</i> reflects not only Meserve's pioneering research, but the work of the many Lincoln scholars who followed in his footsteps and the work of five generations of Meserve's family who advanced his scholarship. The new volume is edited by Peter W. Kunhardt, Jr., the executive director of the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation, who brings his expertise on Lincoln, having previously coauthored two titles on the president. This new edition of <i>The Photographs of Abraham Lincoln</i> is an essential and intimate collection of portraits of the legendary president, and an important volume for American archival and photographic history.</p><p>The story of his family&#x2019;s devotion to Lincoln is the subject of &#x201c;Living With Lincoln,&#x201d; a documentary that premieres tonight on HBO. It coincides with &#x201c;The Photographs of Abraham Lincoln,&#x201d; an impressive &#x2015; and imposing &#x2015; photo book published by Steidl and the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation. Yet intertwined with American history is his family&#x2019;s own history, a take born not of great deeds, but of a great need: a son wanting to reconnect with his father.

Watching Little Buddy's path to adoption as told through the perspective of Reagan will have you laughing and wiping your eyes. This book delivers a great message that adopted children are special and should feel that way because their parents chose them. So too with Reagan, a special dog that was chosen by his "parents."<br>It does a good job of also illustrating the difficulty with letting go of a foster child once they're adopted. These foster families give love and a happy home with the understanding that they will eventually be forced to give the children up and yet do it anyway. My family fosters dogs, and I know this difficulty as well. We bring them in to our homes, often from sad circumstances, and feed, love, and care for them only to see them leave eventually. What helps is knowing that with both children, and animals, they are going to their forever home and that makes it worthwhile.<br><br>Makes a fantastic gift to anyone.</p><h2>Leading in Prayer: A Workbook for Worship</h2><p>This comprehensive guide to ordering, improving, and doing prayer in Christian corporate worship is for pastors, worship leaders, teachers and anyone interested in a deeper understanding of the use of public prayer.

One of the most famous qigong masters of this century, Master Li Ching-yun is reliably chronicled to have lived more than 250 years, during which he practiced the Eight Brocades on a daily basis. His longevity and personal endorsements attest to and validate the Eight Brocades as the quintessence of Taoist health and qigong practices. <br> <br>With Master Li Ching-yun&#x2019;s time-honored teachings as a guide, Stuart Olson presents an authentic yet accessible approach to this unique practice. Each exercise begins with its original Eight Brocades text, which comes from the Kao Lin stone engraving of the old Hangchou period, followed by Master Li&#x2019;s interpretation of that text and explanatory comments from Olson. Also included are step-by-step instructions for each exercise, fully illustrated with detailed photographs of Olson performing the exercises. Because the Eight Brocades are the foundation of all qigong, this book provides valuable advice for all practitioners, regardless of the style they practice or the depth of their experience. <br> <br>STUART ALVE OLSON currently teaches Eight Brocade Qigong, Taoist meditation, and I T&#x2019;ai Chi. He has studied under numerous Taoist masters including Ch&#x2019;an master Hsuan Hua, Kung fu and healing master Oei Khong-hwei, Dharma master Cheng Yi, and T&#x2019;ai Chi Ch&#x2019;uan master T. T.

Frank explores the events of illness from within: the transformation from person to patient, the pain, the wonder,and the ceremony of recovery. To illuminate what illness can teach us about life, Frank draws upon his own encounters with serious illness -- a heart attack at age thirty-nine and, a year later, a diagnosis of cancer. In poignant and clear prose, he offers brilliant insights into what happens when our bodies and emotions are pushed to extremes. Ultimately, he examines what it means to be human.</p><p>Arthur W. Frank received the Natalie Davis Spingarn Writer&#x2019;s Award from the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship in 1996. He teaches at the University of Calgary.Within two years, Frank experienced life-threatening illness twice: a heart attack at age 39 and cancer at 40. These crises motivated him to write "a letter to his younger self" before he was made wiser by the experience of disease. Instead of focusing on medical details, he attempts to describe the human experience in an effort to make sense of serious illness. Writing that "illness teaches the danger as well as the value of the everyday," Frank emphasizes the value of life and a return to the sense of wonder at being alive. What he has to say about caregiving complements Norman Cousins's holistic health and vis medicatrix naturae philosophy presented in his Anatomy of an Illness as Perceived by the Patient ( LJ 9/1/79).<br><i>- James Swanton, Albert Einstein Coll. of Medicine, New York</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Michigan Modern: Design that Shaped America</h2><p><p><i>Michigan Modern: Design That Shaped America</i> is an impressive collection of important essays touching on all aspects of Michigan&#x2019;s architecture and design heritage.</p> <p>The Great Lakes State has always been known for its contributions to twentieth-century manufacturing, but it&#x2019;s only beginning to receive wide attention for its contributions to Modern design and architecture.

I don't know why that particular tree appealed to me. Perhaps it was because it looked as if it had given up and died years ago and was still standing because it didn't know what else to do. . .<br><br> In her deliciously funny, heartfelt, and moving debut, Cathy Lamb introduces some of the most wonderfully eccentric women since <i>The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood </i>and <i>The Secret Life of Bees,</i> as she explores the many ways we find the road home. <br><br> From the moment Julia Bennett leaves her abusive Boston fianc� at the altar and her ugly wedding dress hanging from a tree in South Dakota, she knows she's driving away from the old Julia, but what she's driving toward is as messy and undefined as her own wounded soul. The old Julia dug her way out of a tortured, trailer park childhood with a monster of a mother. The new Julia will be found at her Aunt Lydia's rambling, hundred-year-old farmhouse outside Golden, Oregon. <br><br> There, among uppity chickens and toilet bowl planters, Julia is welcomed by an eccentric, warm, and often wise clan of women, including a psychic, a minister's unhappy wife, an abused mother of four, and Aunt Lydia herself--a woman who is as fierce and independent as they come. Meeting once a week for drinks and the baring of souls, it becomes clear that every woman holds secrets that keep her from happiness. But what will it take for them to brave becoming their true selves? For Julia, it's chocolate. All her life, baking has been her therapy and her refuge, a way to heal wounds and make friends. Nobody anywhere makes chocolates as good as Julia's, and now, chocolate just might change her life--and bring her love when she least expects it. But it can't keep her safe. As Julia gradually opens her heart to new life, new friendships, and a new man, the past is catching up to her. And this time, she will not be able to run but will have to face it head on. <br><br> Filled with warmth, love, and truth, <i>Julia's Chocolates</i> is an unforgettable novel of hope and healing that explores the hurts we keep deep in our hearts, the love that liberates us, the courage that defines us, and the chocolate that just might take us there. <br><br><b>Advance praise for Cathy Lamb and Julia's Chocolates</b> <br><br> <i>"Julia's Chocolates </i>is wise, tender, and very funny.

When she and her turtle, Alfred, notice that their new friend, Frannie the caterpillar, has vanished, Pipsie is on the case. She grabs her magnifying glass, goes to her tree-house headquarters, and begins to search for clues. It&#x2019;s time to make this mystery history!</p><p>Bursting with personality, this engaging story introduces a spunky new girl detective, a scooter-driving turtle who loves to eat, and a string of simple scientific clues that will keep kids turning the pages until the mystery is solved.

Turtle, befriends a baby caterpillar named Frannie. When Frannie mysteriously disappears, Pipsie zealously relies on her keen detective skills to find her. From a chewed-up milkweed leaf to dangly chrysalis to monarch butterfly, Pipsie and Alfred eventually reunite with their friend, who is now blessed with newfound wings. Due to a job well done, mystery successfully becomes history. While some readers may already know what happens to the missing caterpillar before the story even begins, there's solid information about metamorphosis to be gleaned from the fictional narrative. Additional fun facts are presented at the end of the book. Bishop's bright, cheerful illustrations capture Pipsie's earnest joy in her scientific quest. This is further enhanced by her silly sidekick, Alfred Turtle, who is more interested in gulping down clues for lunch than getting the job done. DeDonato has Pipsie follow some essential steps for scientific inquiry: firsthand inspection for clues followed by consultation with an expert in the field (the zoo man with the badge). The ideal follow-up lesson would be a similar hunt for caterpillars and/or other natural wonders.

Perfect clothes. Perfect family. Perfect house. Perfect job. We strive for excellence in all areas of our lives. And there's nothing wrong with a healthy, mature pursuit of excellence. But what begins as healthy and normal can sometimes become neurotic and abnormal, leading to debilitating thoughts and behaviors: <ul><li>eating disorders</li><li>anxiety and depression</li><li>obsession and compulsions</li><li>fear of failure</li><li>relational dysfunction</li></ul> In <em>Perfecting Ourselves to Death,</em> Richard Winter explores the positive and negative effects of perfectionism on our lives. He looks at the seductive nature of perfectionism as it is reflected in today's media. He examines the price and perils of perfectionism. And he explores the roots of perfectionism, delving into what originally awakens this drive in us. After analyzing the negative feelings and defeatist behaviors that unhealthy perfectionism births, he provides practical strategies for how to change. "The important thing to see," writes Winter, "is that we are to strive to become better people, not just to be content with who we are or how we measure up to the standards of the culture around us." For Christians this means becoming more like Christ in every area of our lives. Here is the "perfect" book for those who struggle with perfectionism and for those pastors, counselors and friends who want to understand and help perfectionists.</p><p><strong>Richard Winter,</strong> a psychiatrist, is professor of practical theology at Covenant Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. He is the author of <em>Still Bored in a Culture of Entertainment.</em>"Are we called to be perfect by Jesus? Yes. Are we capable of being perfect? Absolutely not. Richard Winter in his generous, brilliant and compelling style ushers us through the conundrum and then takes us to the glory of a God who was perfect on my behalf to bear the weight of my imperfection. This book is hopeful beyond words and a delight to read. You will be prepared to know the profound desire to be holy against the unholy desire to be perfect. Prepare to fly in the face of the false god of perfectionism." (Dan B. Allender, President, Mars Hill Graduate School, and author of The Wounded Heart and To Be Told)<br><br>"What is the difference between striving for excellence and seeking perfection? The former is attainable, the latter is not. The former spurs us on, the latter so often leads to chronic frustration, even despair and depression.<br><br> "In <em>Perfecting Ourselves to Death</em> Dr. Winter ably explores this apparent paradox, and charts the emergence of perfectionism with its varied origins in our genetic inheritance, upbringing, temperament and motivation.<br><br> "As a teacher and counselor, he combines a background of medicine and psychiatry along with a clear biblical foundation and many years of pastoral experience. The result is a book which is thoughtful, clear and accessible and will provide an invaluable practical resource for preachers, counselors and sufferers alike." (Monty Barker, Consultant Psychiatrist and Visiting Professor of Psychiatry and Pastoral Care)<br><br>"Here is a clinically competent discipling resource that has been written to help Christians see how dehumanizing perfectionism spoils lives and to show how it may be overcome in Christ. To the other-oriented perfectionists, self-oriented perfectionists and other frazzled folk whom Professor Winter addresses he shows himself a truly wise guide." (J. I. Packer, Board of Governors Professor of Theology, Regent College)<br><br>"Somewhere in each of us there is always a voice that says, 'Not yet have you done enough.' Richard Winter helps us identify the source of the voice, whether it echoes from ancient caverns of parental criticism, the packaged idealisms of pop culture or the streams of doubt flowing from a damaged soul. Then he surprises us by showing that the echoes cannot come from everywhere if they are not true. The joy of this wonderful book is not its denial of the truths of our perfectionism but the writer's delight in the greater truths that drown the echoes of our self-doubt in a voice of love far greater."

Based upon pathbreaking fieldwork conducted in the 1930s and 1950s among oral epic singers of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia, Lord analyzes in impressive detail the techniques of oral composition in performance. He explores the consequences of this analysis for the interpretation of numerous works of traditional verbal art, including&#x2015;in addition to South Slavic epic songs&#x2015;the Homeric <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>, <i>Beowulf</i>, the <i>Chanson de Roland</i>, and the Byzantine epic <i>Digenis Akritas</i>.

The book covers the science of using data to build models, improve decisions, and ultimately add value to institutions and individuals. </p> <p>The philosophical underpinnings of the book are that real world problems are usually complex and often will defined; they do not come with labels, meaning that they are not necessarily regression problems or optimization problems. The only objective reality is data, which itself may be incomplete and of questionable quality, and the role of models is to facilitate the solution of real world problems. Problems and data play a leading role in this book, while models play an essential but supporting role. This is in contrast with the vast majority of books and classes available today, in which methods play the leading role. </p> <p> Dimitris Bertsimas is the Boeing Professor of Operations Research and the co-director of the Operations Research Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Combine the milk and water in a small pitcher, then blend the liquid into the flour mixture a little at a time, mixing well with either a fork or an electric mixer to beat out any lumps. Mix in 2 tablespoons of melted butter and the sugar, then transfer the mixture to a measuring pitcher and set aside.<br> &nbsp;<br> Set a heatproof plate over a pan of simmering water&#x2014;you can keep the cooked cr�pes warm by stacking them on this plate.<br> &nbsp;<br> Heat a 7-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle in 1 teaspoon of the melted butter and tilt the pan to spread it around the base of the pan. Quickly pour in just enough cr�pe batter to barely coat the base (you want a nice, thin cr�pe, not a pancake) and tilt the pan to spread the batter evenly. Cook until the edges start to curl up, about 1 minute, then use a knife to tease the edge of the cr�pes over to check if the underside is golden and, if so, flip the cr�pe (use a spatula if you like) and cook until the underside is golden brown, a further 30 seconds or so. Transfer the cr�pe to the warm plate and cover with parchment paper. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding 1 teaspoon melted butter to the pan each time. Keep the cr�pes warm while you cook the topping.<br> &nbsp;<br> Put the superfine sugar in a shallow dish. Dip the 2 cut sides of each banana slice into the sugar to coat.<br> &nbsp;<br> Put 2 tablespoons of the butter into a large frying pan set over high heat. Add half the banana slices and fry until slightly caramelized, or no more than 1 minute on each side. Remove from the pan and repeat with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and banana slices.<br> &nbsp;<br> To serve, place a few banana slices across half of each cr�pe. Scatter over the pistachios and drizzle a little honey over each. Fold into quarters and serve immediately.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Uses of Plants by the Indians of the Missouri River Region</h2><p>A classic of ethnobotany, <i>Uses of Plants by the Indians of the Missouri River Region</i> has been enlarged for this Bison Book edition with thirty drawings, by Bellamy Parks Jansen, of plants discussed by Gilmore.

As nature s recyclers, decomposers are a necessary part of a ecosystem. I just love reviewing books from the Graphic Library series, because I learn so much. I don t know if I have forgotten over time or if I never learned complex science theories, but these books are super, presenting them in an interesting and understandable way! Max Axiom takes the reader on a journey explaining the how the ecosystems work. He uses powers that he acquired in a freak accident to make himself as small as an atom, and he wears a lab coat that allows him to travel through time. Throughout the book, the author includes boxes with further information and explanations of the topics being discussed. This is particularly useful in helping the reader understand the topics. At the end of the book, the reader will find more facts on the ecosystem, a list of books on the same topic, and Internet sites. Vocabulary has been well-chosen, and the full-color graphics make an enormous impact on the story. The graphic novel style is perfect for students who are reluctant readers and never seem to finish a book on their own. Young adults who want to read anything they can get their hands on will also enjoy the graphics and fast-paced text. This book is an excellent resource that could be used for writing a summary, a book report, or as a source for research.

Olympus. Her friends, Joel, Paelen, and&#x2014;of course&#x2014;Pegasus, are there as well. The only person missing is Emily&#x2019;s father, who is still being held prisoner by the CRU back in the human world. Emily wants to go find him, but Jupiter won&#x2019;t allow her to leave.

A place where rain didn&#x2019;t fall but the lush green gardens never wilted. Flowers bloomed constantly, filling the air with their intoxicating fragrances. The air itself seemed alive. It was honey sweet and warm and enveloped you in a blanket of peace; it was rich with the sounds of singing birds and filled with insects that never stung. If a bee landed on you, it was only because it wanted to be petted.<br> <br>The buildings in Olympus were as beautiful and unique as the land itself. Most were made of smooth white marble with tall, intricately carved pillars reaching high into the clear blue sky. There were open theaters where the Muses danced and sang for the entertainment of all.<br> <br>The wide cobbled streets were lined with statues of the strongest fighters and heroes. There were no cars or trucks pumping pollution into the air. The Olympians walked or flew wherever they needed to go. Occasionally they would ride in a chariot drawn by magnificent horses.<br> <br>Then there were the libraries, more than Emily could count, containing the texts from the many worlds the Olympians visited and guarded. Some of her favorite books were in the library at Jupiter&#x2019;s palace, brought in especially for her.<br> <br>Emily could never have imagined a more perfect place.<br> <br>But living in Olympus, amid all this splendor, Emily was miserable.<br> <br>She missed her father. She spent every waking moment thinking and worrying about him. He was back in her world, a prisoner of the Central Research Unit. The CRU was a secret government agency obsessed with capturing aliens and anything out of the ordinary to use as weapons. She had been their prisoner for a short time and knew how single-minded and cruel they were. But they still had her father. What were they doing to him? Were they punishing him because of her escape? Had they killed him? So many fears and unanswered questions tore at her heart that she could never be completely happy or stop worrying about him.<br> <br>Even spending time with Pegasus didn&#x2019;t ease the pain. Emily was desperate to get back to New York to find her father, but Jupiter wouldn&#x2019;t let her go. He insisted her place was here among the other Olympians. And with the invading warrior race of Nirads still posing a threat to Olympus, Jupiter couldn&#x2019;t risk sending any of his fighters to Emily&#x2019;s world on a rescue mission. No matter how much she pleaded with the god, he refused to allow her to leave.<br> <br>Emily paused as she walked through the gardens of Jupiter&#x2019;s palace. She raised her face to the sun and felt its warm rays streaming down on her. Was this the same sun that shone in her world? Was her father allowed to see it? From her own experience as a prisoner in the CRU&#x2019;s deep underground facility, she doubted it.<br> <br>Emily felt even more determined. If Jupiter wouldn&#x2019;t let her go, she had no choice but to run away and rescue her father herself. Walking along the stream that coursed through Olympus, she saw a group of beautiful water nymphs splashing on the shore. They waved and called their strange greeting. Moments later they slipped beneath the surface, and the water calmed as if they&#x2019;d never been there.<br> <br>Lost in thought, Emily wasn&#x2019;t paying attention to where she was walking and tripped over a small rock. She cursed and righted herself. On top of everything else, she was still getting used to the new gold leg brace that Vulcan, the armorer of Olympus, had made for her. He had constructed it using the same gold as Pegasus&#x2019;s bridle. A very special gold that was lethal to Nirads. With one brief touch they were badly poisoned. Longer contact proved fatal to the ferocious warriors. With this brace Emily could not only defend herself against the invaders, she could walk and run once again.<br> <br>But learning to get around with the strange device had taken time and effort. Now she could almost move as well as she had before her leg was permanently damaged by the Nirads in New York.<br> <br>She walked toward Jupiter&#x2019;s maze, a large labyrinth built in the middle of a garden and consisting of tall green bushes grown in complicated patterns. It took a lot of practice to navigate it, but Emily and her friends had discovered that the maze was the perfect place to hold private conversations.<br> <br>Emily found her way through the labyrinth, where Pegasus was waiting for her beside the pedestal at the center. The magnificent winged stallion always stole her breath. Standing quietly in the dark of the trees, he glowed brilliant white. His head was high and proud, and his coat shiny and well groomed. There wasn&#x2019;t a feather out of place on his neatly folded wings.<br> <br>When Pegasus saw her, he whinnied excitedly and nodded his head.<br> <br>Beside the winged horse stood Emily&#x2019;s best friend from New York, Joel. Joel&#x2019;s Roman features, black hair, and warm brown eyes always reminded her of the classic Italian paintings she&#x2019;d seen in the art museum. He was no longer the violent, angry boy she had first met. Spending time in Olympus had softened his outer shell of rage and hurt due to the loss of his family. Now he let others see that he had a deeply caring heart and a ready laugh. Joel spent his days working with Vulcan in the Olympus armory. He had even helped design the brace on Emily&#x2019;s leg.<br> <br>Emily looked around. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Paelen?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be here in a few minutes. He had something to pick up.&#x201d; Joel reached for her elbow. &#x201c;Em, you&#x2019;re absolutely sure you want to do this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What choice have I got?&#x201d; Emily answered. &#x201c;Joel, all I think about is saving my dad. There&#x2019;s nothing else I can do. We wouldn&#x2019;t have to sneak around like this if Jupiter would help!&#x201d; She threw her hands up in frustration. As she brought them down, brilliant flames flashed from her fingertips, hit the edge of her good foot, and scorched the ground around it. Emily howled and hopped in pain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Emily, calm down!&#x201d; Joel warned. &#x201c;You know it gets worse when you&#x2019;re upset.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nuts!&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;Being the Flame of Olympus is one thing. But constantly setting myself on fire is another!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to calm down,&#x201d; Joel insisted. &#x201c;Remember what Vesta taught you. You can control the Flame if you remain calm.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s easier said than done,&#x201d; Emily complained as she sat down and rubbed her singed foot. Ever since she emerged from the Temple of the Flame, she was discovering powers she couldn&#x2019;t control. Powers that continually set things alight.<br> <br>Joel sat down beside her. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get your dad out of there. I promise. But you can&#x2019;t help him if you can&#x2019;t control the Flame.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Joel&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; Paelen emerged from the trees behind them. In contrast to Joel, he was small and wiry, and he was able to get into the tiniest of spaces. Paelen had a notorious habit of getting into trouble, but with his crooked grin and dark, sparkling eyes, he always found a way to make Emily smile. &#x201c;And if I were you, I would lower your voices. Half the maze can hear your conversation.&#x201d; He sat down beside Emily and gave her a playful shove. &#x201c;Set yourself on fire again I see.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I tripped,&#x201d; Emily answered, shoving him back.<br> <br>Paelen smiled his crooked smile. &#x201c;Of course you did; which is why your sandal is charcoal and still smoldering.&#x201d;<br> <br>In the time they&#x2019;d spent in Olympus, Emily had really grown to like Paelen. Between him and Joel, she couldn&#x2019;t have asked for better friends. Paelen was also one of the few Olympians who understood what they&#x2019;d been through as prisoners of the CRU on Governors Island.<br> <br>&#x201c;Speaking of sandals&#x201d;&#x2014;Emily changed the subject&#x2014;&#x201c;you didn&#x2019;t steal Mercury&#x2019;s again, did you?&#x201d; She noticed the winged sandals on his feet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Me? Of course not,&#x201d; Paelen said in mock horror. &#x201c;You know I&#x2019;m no longer a thief. Mercury just gave them to me. He is having another set made for himself.&#x201d; Paelen paused and frowned. &#x201c;He said the sandals prefer to stay with me. I do not understand what he means, but I&#x2019;m not going to say no to such a useful gift.&#x201d; He petted the tiny wings on the sandals. &#x201c;These flying sandals saved our lives in your world and helped us escape the CRU. There is no telling what else they can do.&#x201d; He leaned closer to Emily and eagerly rubbed his hands together. &#x201c;So, tell me. When do we leave for New York?&#x201d;<br> <br>Pegasus stepped forward and started to nicker.<br> <br>Paelen nodded and translated for the others. &#x201c;Pegasus heard Jupiter, Mars, and Hercules talking. They are going on an expedition to see if they can discover how the Nirads entered Olympus in such large numbers without being seen. Until they know and can secure the route, we are still in danger. Pegasus suggests if we are going to go to New York to rescue your father, we should leave once they&#x2019;re gone.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emily rose and kissed the stallion on his soft muzzle. &#x201c;Thank you, Pegasus. That&#x2019;s a great idea.&#x201d; She turned to Joel and Paelen. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s settled, then. The moment Jupiter leaves, we&#x2019;re out of here!&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Quietly they discussed their plans as they strolled through the maze. Emily rested her hand on Pegasus&#x2019;s neck as he walked beside her.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need some human clothes,&#x201d; Joel mused aloud. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t arrive back in New York dressed like this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What is wrong with these?&#x201d; Paelen looked down at his tunic. &#x201c;I have always dressed this way.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding, right?&#x201d; Joel smirked. &#x201c;Paelen, we look like rejects from a gladiator movie! Look at me&#x2014;I&#x2019;m wearing a dress!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a tunic,&#x201d; Emily corrected him, &#x201c;and I think it suits you.&#x201d; She looked down at her own beautiful gown made from fine white embroidered silk with an intricate braided gold belt at her waist. The material ended above the golden brace on her damaged left leg, leaving it exposed. Emily had never felt embarrassed revealing the deep, angry scars from the Nirad wounds while she was on Olympus. The Olympians regarded them as a badge of honor. She had earned them in the service of Olympus, and she had learned to be proud of them. But as she gazed down at her leg now, she realized that the deep scars and leg brace wouldn&#x2019;t be viewed as positively in her world.<br> <br>&#x201c;Joel&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t go back there like this either. We&#x2019;ve got to hide this brace.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pegasus started to neigh, and Paelen translated. &#x201c;If anyone should try to steal it from you, Pegasus would defend you, as would Joel and I.&#x201d; A playful twinkle returned to his eyes. &#x201c;Of course, should that fail, you could always set yourself on fire again. That would surely scare off any attackers!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Paelen,&#x201d; Emily teased as she shoved him lightly. Then she patted Pegasus on the neck. &#x201c;And thank you, Pegs. But I still think we will need to find other clothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Other clothing for what?&#x201d;<br> <br>Emily looked up at the owner of the new voice. Despite all the time they&#x2019;d spent in Olympus, she still couldn&#x2019;t get over the sight of Cupid. Seeing Pegasus&#x2019;s wings had been strange at the beginning. But somehow they suited him. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine him without them. But looking at a teenager with colorful, pheasantlike feathered wings on his back was something else.<br> <br>Cupid pulled in his wings and landed neatly in the maze before them. &#x201c;So, where are you going that you need new clothing?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;None of your business,&#x201d; Joel shot back. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t your mother ever teach you any manners? It&#x2019;s not polite to listen in on other people&#x2019;s conversation.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Cupid said. &#x201c;But she also taught me that when humans and Olympians mix, there is always trouble. And what do I see before my curious eyes? Humans mixing with Olympians.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cupid smiled radiantly at Emily, and it set her heart fluttering. She had a terrible crush on him, and he knew it. He was the most beautiful Olympian she had ever met, with fine features, light sandy blond hair, sapphire blue eyes that sparkled, and skin like polished marble. Though Cupid was very old, he looked no more than sixteen or seventeen.<br> <br>Emily stole a glance at Joel and saw his temper starting to flare. The way Cupid pronounced the word &#x201c;humans&#x201d; was always meant as an insult. &#x201c;Get out of here, Cupid,&#x201d; Joel warned. &#x201c;This is a private conversation, and you are <i>not</i> welcome.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is this true?&#x201d; Cupid said slyly to Emily. &#x201c;Do you really wish me to go?&#x201d;<br> <br>The intensity of his stare kept the words from forming on her lips. Everything about him was trouble. Joel had told her some of the myths concerning Cupid. She knew that, like a coward, he had fled the area when the Nirads first attacked and had stayed away until the danger had gone. Yet despite all this, she couldn&#x2019;t tell him to go.<br> <br>Before the moment became awkward, Pegasus stepped forward and snorted loudly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Trouble?&#x201d; Cupid repeated as he turned and feigned innocence to the stallion. &#x201c;I am not causing trouble. I just wanted to speak with the Flame.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Her name is Emily,&#x201d; Paelen said defensively. He moved to stand in front of Emily to block her from Cupid. &#x201c;Do not call her Flame.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And I told you to leave,&#x201d; Joel added, taking position beside Paelen and crossing his arms over his chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Or what?&#x201d; Cupid challenged. &#x201c;What will you do to me, human?&#x201d;<br> <br>Once again Pegasus snorted, and he pounded the ground with a golden hoof. There was no mistaking the warning. Emily saw fear rise in Cupid&#x2019;s eyes. Even Paelen took a cautious step back from the stallion.<br> <br>&#x201c;There is no need to lose your temper, Pegasus.&#x201d; Cupid held up his hands in surrender. &#x201c;I shall go.&#x201d;<br> <br>His wings opened as he prepared to fly. But before leaving, Cupid plucked a colorful feather from his right wing and placed it in Emily&#x2019;s hair. &#x201c;Something to put under your pillow to remember me by,&#x201d; he said as he jumped into the air and flapped his large wings. &#x201c;See you later, Flame!&#x201d;<br> <br>Pegasus reared on his hind legs, opened his own huge wings, and shrieked into the sky after him.<br> <br>As Cupid escaped, he turned and waved back at her, laughing as he went.<br> <br>&#x201c;I came this close to hitting him!&#x201d; Joel said, balling his hands into fists.<br> <br>&#x201c;Me too,&#x201d; Paelen said.<br> <br>Pegasus gently nudged Emily and nickered softly.<br> <br>&#x201c;You must stay away from Cupid,&#x201d; Paelen explained. &#x201c;Pegasus says he is trouble. Even more than&#x2014;What?&#x201d; Paelen turned sharply to the stallion. &#x201c;Me? Pegasus, how can you compare Cupid to me? We are nothing alike. I may have been a thief, but Cupid is a troublemaking coward, and I resent being compared to him. And what about you?&#x201d; Paelen turned to Emily. He pulled the feather from her hair and tossed it to the ground. &#x201c;You should have told him to go. Cupid would think nothing of handing you over to the Nirads if it meant saving his own skin and feathers. Stay away from him!&#x201d;<br> <br>Emily watched in complete confusion as Paelen stormed off into the maze and disappeared. Paelen had never shown any trace of anger or raised his voice to her before. &#x201c;What did I do?&#x201d;<br> <br>Joel looked at her in surprise. &#x201c;You really don&#x2019;t know?&#x201d;<br> <br>When she shook her head, he said, &#x201c;Never mind. We&#x2019;ve got bigger things to worry about. You must learn to control those powers of yours before we leave. You&#x2019;ve got your training session with Vesta. Keep it and learn as much as you can.&#x201d;<br> <br>As Joel walked away, Emily turned to Pegasus and shook her head. &#x201c;You know something, Pegs? The older I get, the more confused I get. Can you please tell me what just happened here?&#x201d;<br> <br>Pegasus gently nudged her and led her back toward Jupiter&#x2019;s palace to find Vesta.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Emily spent a long afternoon back in the Temple of the Flame struggling to learn how to master her powers.

She lives on Nantucket.On this early December day, snowflakes sparkled down to earth like granted wishes from a magic wand. <br><br> Inside the handsome lounge of The Haven, Yule logs blazed cheerfully in the fireplace, while Presley, Sinatra, and Springsteen sang Christmas carols. Near the long casement windows, five women were looping lights around a Norway spruce so tall they had to use a ladder to reach the highest branches.<br><br> &#x201c;Okay, that&#x2019;s the end of the last string,&#x201d; Marilyn called from behind the fat tree.<br><br> &#x201c;Plug them in,&#x201d; Shirley told her.<br><br> Marilyn knelt to fit the plug into the socket.<br><br> &#x201c;Oooooooh!&#x201d; Shirley, Faye, Alice, Marilyn, and Polly sighed with delight as dozens and dozens of multicolored miniature lights twinkled to life.<br><br> &#x201c;Now,&#x201d; Shirley announced, &#x201c;for the fun part. How shall we do this?&#x201d; Shirley was the director of The Haven, but the four other women were her best friends, practically her family, and she wanted to please everyone.<br><br> &#x201c;I think we should all hang the ornaments we brought where we want,&#x201d; Polly suggested.<br><br> &#x201c;But keep in mind,&#x201d; Faye added, &#x201c;it will look better if the heaviest, biggest ornaments go on the bottom boughs, with the smaller ones on the higher branches.&#x201d; She was an artist, with an artist&#x2019;s eye.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, but we don&#x2019;t want it to look too perfect,&#x201d; Alice insisted. &#x201c;We want it to look real.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good point, Alice,&#x201d; Shirley agreed. &#x201c;Perfection, as we all know, isn&#x2019;t real.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sometimes it is,&#x201d; Marilyn disagreed, in her thoughtful, vague way. &#x201c;The horseshoe crab, genus Limulus, for example, is perfect. Its design hasn&#x2019;t changed since the Triassic period, that&#x2019;s two hundred forty-five million years.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Lovely,&#x201d; Faye said gently, amused. &#x201c;Still, we really don&#x2019;t want to hang a horseshoe crab on the Christmas tree.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I suppose not. Although one year we did.&#x201d; Marilyn smiled at the memory. She was a paleobiologist&#x2014;the others teasingly called her a pale old biologist&#x2014;and her grown son and her ex-husband were molecular geneticists. &#x201c;Teddy was nine, and fascinated with crustaceans and fossils, so we bored holes in lots of shells, slipped colored cords through, and hung the tree with crabs, mollusks, and gastropods.&#x201d;<br><br> Alice snorted with laughter. &#x201c;You are so weird!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Polly chimed in. &#x201c;David told me that he and Amy are hanging only homemade decorations on their tree. And my daughter-in-law is such a purist, she&#x2019;ll use only vegetable dyes, natural wood, straw, and such. Afterwards, they&#x2019;ll probably carry the tree outside and feed the entire thing to the goat.&#x201d;<br><br> The others laughed. As they talked, they moved back and forth from the tables and couches where the boxes of decorations were set out. Occasionally Shirley dropped another log on the fire.<br><br> The spacious room, with its casement windows, high ceilings, and mahogany paneling, seemed to glow with contentment. Once built to house a private boarding school, this old stone lodge had been abandoned for a few years. Then Shirley, with the help of her friends and a few investors, had bought it and opened The Haven, a premier spa and wellness resort with a burgeoning membership and second-floor condos for staff or friends.<br><br> She had staff (she had staff! Shirley, who had struggled financially most of her life, got a thrill every time she remembered that). But she hadn&#x2019;t wanted her staff to decorate the Christmas tree, and neither had her friends. They&#x2019;d wanted to do this together. They&#x2019;d agreed to bring three boxes of decorations each, and they&#x2019;d agreed to do it without advance discussion or collaboration, so their choices would be a surprise.<br><br> Now they worked quickly, climbing the ladder to adorn the top, stretching left and right, standing back to appraise, kneeling to the lowest branches, murmuring to themselves, exclaiming at what the others had chosen.<br><br> Shirley was a sucker for whimsical creatures with smiling faces: elves, snowmen, Santa Clauses, cherubs, fat angels with crooked smiles and tilted halos, fairies with freckles and yarn hair.<br><br> Faye had selected expensive glass ornaments: gorgeous faceted stars, elongated teardrops and iridescent icicles, extravagantly striped or translucent balls in gleaming gemstone colors.<br><br> Polly loved to cook. She&#x2019;d baked dozens of gingerbread men and women, sugar-cookie stars, leaping reindeer, trumpets and drummer boys and crescent moons, the absorbing, familiar activity bringing back memories of Christmases when her son was little. She&#x2019;d decorated them with colored icing, silver balls, and sprinkles of colored sugar, and glued ribbons firmly on the back, for hanging. She&#x2019;d also strung cranberries and popcorn on fishing wire and bought boxes of candy canes.<br><br> Alice, less sentimental and more practical, had chosen thirty of the skin care, cosmetic, and aromatherapy products on sale at The Haven, and tied their lavender boxes with glittering gold and silver bows.<br><br> Marilyn&#x2019;s contribution was a boxed set of antique ornaments from the Museum of Fine Arts, and a handmade collection of brass and enamel stars, sun, moon, and planets purchased from an Asian gentleman selling them from a rug on a sidewalk in Harvard Square.<br><br> When every ornament was hung, the five women stepped back to admire their handiwork. The mixture was eccentric, aesthetically enchanting, and wildly cheerful.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fabulous,&#x201d; Shirley said. &#x201c;Let me get my camera.&#x201d;<br><br> Alice said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pour the hot chocolate.&#x201d; She twisted the cap off a large Thermos and poured the fragrant liquid into Christmas mugs&#x2014;little gifts from her to the others. Then, without the slightest twinge of guilt, she took out a can of Reddi-whip, shook it, and topped the drinks with snowy swirls of the white concoction. After that, she opened a little plastic bag, dipped her hand in, and sprinkled dark chocolate shavings on the creamy peaks.<br><br> &#x201c;I brought some Christmas cookies&#x2014;without the glue.&#x201d; Polly opened a red and green tin, and the sweet, warm aroma of butter and sugar rose into the air.<br><br> Marilyn and Faye pushed two of the more comfortable wing chairs close to the sofa so they could all sit in a half-circle, facing the tree. Shirley returned from her office with the camera and began snapping shots of the tree and its trimmers.<br><br> Shirley wore purple Tencel pants with an emerald top that flattered her auburn hair. Her earrings and necklace were miniature battery-operated Christmas lights that blinked on and off.<br><br> Faye wore scarlet trousers in a silk-and-wool weave with a matching jacket over a sleeveless white shell. A chunky choker of garnet and jade circled her neck. Her white hair was held back with a matching barrette.<br><br> Plump, auburn-haired Polly wore jeans and a bright green sweater with white snowmen she&#x2019;d designed and knit herself.<br><br> Alice looked majestic in a velvet tunic and pants of swirling crimson and indigo, embellished with lavish gold embroidery. Earrings, necklace, and bracelets of heavy, scrolled gold gleamed against her dark skin.<br><br> Marilyn wore brown wool trousers and a shapeless gray sweater. She wasn&#x2019;t color-blind; she just kept forgetting to think about her clothing.<br><br> The five curled up on the sofa and settled into the chairs.<br><br> Shirley raised her mug. &#x201c;To the holidays!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;To the holidays!&#x201d; the others toasted.<br><br> They all sipped the rich hot chocolate, and sighed in unison.<br><br> Faye focused dreamily on the twinkling tree. &#x201c;This is going to be the best Christmas ever!&#x201d;<br><br> Alice chuckled. &#x201c;Yes, and I&#x2019;m Glinda, the Good Witch of the North.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Did you know,&#x201d; Shirley informed them, &#x201c;in the movie The Wizard of Oz, Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, was played by an actress named Billie Burke when she was fifty-three years old?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding!&#x201d; Polly nearly spilled her cocoa. &#x201c;She looked so young! All that blond hair. The sparkling pink dress. The tiara.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I wish I had that dress,&#x201d; Faye mused.<br><br> &#x201c;I wish I had her magic wand,&#x201d; Marilyn murmured.<br><br> Alice lazily turned her head toward Marilyn. &#x201c;Really. What would you do with it?&#x201d;<br><br> Marilyn didn&#x2019;t hesitate. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d turn my mother back into her normal, independent self. Oh, yes, and renovate Faraday&#x2019;s sexual abilities.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s still impotent?&#x201d; A former hotshot executive, Alice didn&#x2019;t mince words. Besides, they&#x2019;d helped solve one another&#x2019;s problems before, and were ready to do it again, if they could.<br><br> &#x201c;Always.&#x201d; Marilyn&#x2019;s tone was rich with regret. She&#x2019;d only discovered the joys of sex in her fifties, and she wanted to make up for lost time.<br><br> &#x201c;You need a magic wand to make his wand magic,&#x201d; Polly joked.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on with your mother, Marilyn?&#x201d; Shirley asked.<br><br> Marilyn sighed. &#x201c;My sister says she&#x2019;s going downhill fast. Not physically, mentally. Sharon wants me to have Mother come here for Christmas and stay indefinitely, so I can watch for signs of senility and help her decide whether or not Mother should be &#x2018;persuaded&#x2019; to go into an assisted care facility.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hard decision,&#x201d; Faye sympathized.<br><br> &#x201c;I know.&#x201d; Marilyn pinched the bridge of her nose. &#x201c;Sharon said she can&#x2019;t make this kind of decision herself, and she&#x2019;s absolutely right.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How old is your mom?&#x201d; Alice asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Eighty-five. She lives in Ohio, in the same town where we grew up, only a short drive from my sister&#x2019;s home. I&#x2019;ve always felt guilty that I haven&#x2019;t been able to help Mother as much as Sharon has. But I live so far away, and I don&#x2019;t want to give up my position at MIT.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not to mention,&#x201d; Alice teased, &#x201c;you often have trouble keeping your thoughts in the same millennium, never mind on the same species.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;There is that,&#x201d; Marilyn agreed easily.<br><br> &#x201c;Is Faraday spending the holidays with you?&#x201d; Shirley asked.<br><br> Marilyn nodded. &#x201c;He is. He&#x2019;s got two grown children and some grandchildren, but one lives in California and the other in Ohio.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard when your kids live so far away.&#x201d; Faye looked wistful. &#x201c;Thank heavens, Laura and Megan and Lars are coming back east for Christmas. I can&#x2019;t wait to get my hands on my little granddaughter again. I hope she remembers me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Faye,&#x201d; Alice bossily reminded her, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ve chatted with her every day on your web-cam.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, but it&#x2019;s not the same. I want to hold her. Smell her. Cuddle her.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know exactly what you mean.&#x201d; Polly&#x2019;s son and his family lived only a short drive away geographically, but emotionally, they were on Pluto.<br><br> &#x201c;Will you get to see your grandson for Christmas?&#x201d; Faye asked.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been invited for Christmas dinner.&#x201d; Polly made a face. &#x201c;But it will be at Amy&#x2019;s parents&#x2019; house, and they have piles of relatives, so I know I won&#x2019;t be able to hold Jehoshaphat much. Plus, they&#x2019;re so virtuous. I always feel like Mae West visiting the Amish.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What about Hugh?&#x201d; Alice, Marilyn, Shirley, and Faye all asked in chorus. Polly had been dating the handsome doctor since April, and their hopes for her were high. Polly deserved someone won- derful.<br><br> &#x201c;Hugh&#x2019;s spending Christmas day with his children and his ex-wife.&#x201d; Polly mimed pulling out her hair. &#x201c;The size-six, perpetually dependent, helpless little Betsie.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, that sucks,&#x201d; Shirley said. &#x201c;Come have Christmas with us.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Thanks, but actually, I&#x2019;ve been invited to Christmas dinner at Carolyn&#x2019;s, and I just might go there instead.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, do!&#x201d; Faye told her, impulsively. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there, with Aubrey.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Polly brightened. &#x201c;I wonder whether Carolyn would mind if I brought Hugh.&#x201d;<br><br> Of course she would, Faye thought silently. Carolyn wants her father to marry you. She shifted uncomfortably on the sofa, then leaned forward to grab a cookie. Polly had helped Carolyn during a stressful time in her life, and Carolyn, whose mother had died when Carolyn was just a child, had pounced on Polly as a surrogate mom. Polly was so good-natured and sweet, she didn&#x2019;t seem aware of Carolyn&#x2019;s intentions to match her father up with her, and if she were aware, Polly would be so horrified, she&#x2019;d probably move to Alaska. Faye really liked Polly, the newest member of the Hot Flash Club, and didn&#x2019;t want to cause her any embarrassment.<br><br> Alice looked puzzled. &#x201c;Faye, I thought you said Lars and Laura and baby Megan were coming to have Christmas with you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re coming east, yes,&#x201d; Faye explained. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re spending Christmas Eve and Christmas morning and most of the day with me. They&#x2019;re going to Lars&#x2019;s family for Christmas dinner.&#x201d;<br><br> Alice groaned. &#x201c;Christmas is so complicated!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, but the food&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; Polly pointed out cheerfully.<br><br> Simultaneously, everyone reached forward to grab a cookie. They all laughed.<br><br> &#x201c;I always gain ten pounds over Christmas,&#x201d; Faye moaned, munching.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s impossible not to,&#x201d; Alice assured her as she chewed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s stress eating.&#x201d;<br><br> Polly giggled. &#x201c;Last night I ate a pepperoni pizza, a pint of ice cream, and two bags of mega-butter popcorn.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I can trump that,&#x201d; Alice said. &#x201c;I bought a box of expensive chocolates to take to my bridge group, and last night I sat down and ate them all.&#x201d;<br><br> Shirley licked a curl of cream off her spoon. &#x201c;Hey, Faye. You said you think this will be the best Christmas ever. Want to elaborate?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, I didn&#x2019;t mean ever,&#x201d; Faye corrected herself. &#x201c;The best Christmases I ever had were with Jack, when Laura was a little girl. Christmas is really about children. There&#x2019;s nothing like the joy on their faces, the surprise when they see all the gifts under the tree. This Christmas, Megan is three, old enough to really appreciate everything. Plus, I&#x2019;ve moved into my darling, new little house&#x2014;not that I didn&#x2019;t love living in my condo here at The Haven, Shirley,&#x201d; Faye hastened to assure her friend. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s so nice to have a little place all my own. I&#x2019;ve got three bedrooms, you know, and one is for me, one is a guest bedroom, and one is for Megan! I painted the room myself&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;&#x2014;I saw it the other day,&#x201d; Polly told the others. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s exquisite. A little girl&#x2019;s dream room.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait for Megan to see it!&#x201d; Faye beamed. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s so clever! Do you know what she said? Laura told her to eat the crusts on her bread, and Megan said, &#x2018;Mommy, don&#x2019;t you know? They only put crusts on the bread so you won&#x2019;t get peanut butter on your fingers when you&#x2019;re eating the sandwich.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> Alice was amused. &#x201c;Sounds like she&#x2019;s going to be a lawyer like her father.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve bought so many presents I feel guilty.&#x201d; Faye searched the other women&#x2019;s faces. &#x201c;But isn&#x2019;t this what Christmas is all about? Giving lots and lots of fabulous presents? Spoiling your family?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s about making dreams come true.&#x201d; Shirley&#x2019;s voice was rich with longing.<br><br> &#x201c;First of all, it&#x2019;s a religious holiday,&#x201d; Marilyn reminded them.<br><br> &#x201c;And now it&#x2019;s become one gigantic gimmick for our consumer economy,&#x201d; Alice weighed in with a frown. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re bombarded with ads and sentimental scenes of smiling families around the tree. We&#x2019;re brainwashed with syrupy Christmas music and completely unrealistic promises that our families will be happy if only little Johnny gets a video game or little Mary gets the right doll.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Are things okay with Gideon?&#x201d; Faye asked gently.<br><br> &#x201c;Why do you ask?&#x201d; Alice demanded. &#x201c;Christmas sucks, whether I&#x2019;m happy or not!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I sort of agree with Alice,&#x201d; Polly cut in. &#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t think Christmas sucks, but I do think it&#x2019;s gotten far too commercialized. And it does raise unrealistic expectations.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But where&#x2019;s the joy in life, without unrealistic expectations?&#x201d; Shirley cried.<br><br> Marilyn cocked her head, studying Shirley. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised at you, Shirley. I would have thought you&#x2019;d tell us that Christmas is a festival of light during the darkest days...</p><h2>65 Things to Do When You Retire - More Than 65 Notable Achievers on How to Make the Most of the Rest of Your Life (Milestone Series)</h2><p>A collection of 65 essays that provides practical and entertaining advice about how to create a fulfilling retirement.

Some essayists inspire as they chronicle how they faced the shock and inertia of a suddenly blank calendar after their jobs ended&#x2014;and then rebounded to set (and meet) such diverse post-50 goals as training for the Senior Olympics, moving to another country, returning to writing and founding a prison ministry. Others present step-by-step strategies for putting together a retirement game plan that will suit your temperament, interests and budget." - Wall Street JournalMark Evan Chimsky is Editor-in-chief for the book division of Sellers Publishing.

We will no longer be passive bystanders to the dance of the universe, but will become creative choreographers of matter, life, and intelligence.<br><br>The first section of <i>Visions</i> presents a shocking look at a cyber-world infiltrated by millions of tiny intelligence systems. Part two illustrates how the decoding of DNA's genetic structure will allow humans the "godlike ability to manipulate life almost at will." Finally, VISIONS focuses on the future of quantum physics, in which physicists will perfect new ways to manipulate matter and harness the cosmic energy of the universe.<br><br>What makes Michio Kaku's vision of the science of the future so compelling--and so different from the mere forecasts of most thinkers--is that it is based on the groundbreaking research taking place in labs today, as well as the consensus of over 150 of Kaku's scientific colleagues. Science, for all its breathtaking change, evolves slowly; we can accurately predict, asserts Kaku, what the direction of science will be, based on the paths that are being forged today.<br><br>A thrilling, unique narrative that brings together the thinking of many of the world's most accomplished scientists to explore the world of the future, <i>Visions</i> is science writing at its best.</p><p>Take it easy: that's Michio Kaku's motto. Given the extraordinary advances science has thrown up in time for the millennium, the only way you could possibly fit them into a single volume is by a correspondingly massive simplification. <p> Subtitled <i>How Science Will Revolutionize the 21st Century and Beyond</i>, <i>Visions</i> assumes that, by and large, scientists get to do whatever they like, that all technologies are consumer technologies, and that consumers welcome anything and everything science throws at them. Kaku gets away with this frankly dodgy strategy by dint of sheer hard work. He has based his predictions on interviews with more than 150 renowned working scientists; he integrates these interviews with a huge body of original journalistic material; and, above all, he roots that mass of information on an entirely reasonable model of what the purpose of science will be in the third millennium. Up until now, science has expended its efforts on decoding most of the fundamental natural processes--"the dance," as Kaku puts it, of elementary particles deep inside stars and the rhythms of DNA molecules coiling and uncoiling within our bodies. Science's task now, Kaku believes, is to cross-pollinate advances thrown up by the study of matter, biology, and mind--modern science's three main theaters of endeavor. "We are now making the transition from amateur chess players to grand masters," he writes, "from observers to choreographers of nature." Then again, he also believes that "the Internet ... will eventually become a 'Magic Mirror' that appears in fairy tales, able to speak with the wisdom of the human race." Kaku, in short, deserves a good slapping--but he also deserves to be read. <i>--Simon Ings, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Critical acclaim for Michio Kaku's previous book, <i>Hyperspace:</i><p>"Among the best of its genre to appear in recent years...What a wonderful adventure it is, trying to think the unthinkable!"<br><i>--The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"A roller coaster of an intellectual ride through the extraordinary world of black holes, wormholes, parallel universes, higher dimensions and time travel."<br><i>--Philadelphia Inquirer</i></p><p>"Mesmerizing...the reader exits dizzy, elated and looking at the world in a <br>literally revolutionary way."<br><i>--Washington Post</i></p><p></p></p><h2>The Praise of Folly (Illustrated by Hans Holbein)</h2><p><p>In <em>Civilization</em>, Kenneth Clarke states "The first man to take full advantage of the printing press was Erasmus. It made him, and unmade him, because in a way he became the first journalist. He had all the qualifications: a clear, elegant style (in Latin, of course, which meant that he could be read everywhere, but not by everyone), opinions on every subject, even the gift of putting things so that they could be interpreted in different ways. He poured out pamphlets and anthologies and introductions; and so in a few years did everyone who had views on anything... for ten years he was the most famous man in Europe. ... Early in his journalistic career he produced a masterpiece of the Renaissance - <em>ThePraise of Folly</em>. He wrote it staying with his friend Thomas More; he said it took him a week, and I dare say it's true. ... To an intelligent man, human beings and human institutions really are intolerably stupid and there are times when his pent-up feelings of impatience and annoyance can't be contained any longer. Erasmus's Praise of Folly was a dam-burst of this kind; it washed away everything: popes, kings, monks (of course), scholars, war, theology - the whole lot. This edition also contains a brief life of Erasmus and Erasmus's epistle to Thomas More. It is illustrated in monochrome woodcuts by Hans Holbein.</p></p><p></p><h2>Animalkind: Remarkable Discoveries about Animals and Revolutionary New Ways to Show Them Compassion</h2><p><b>The founder and president of PETA, Ingrid Newkirk, and bestselling author Gene Stone explore the wonders of animal life and offer tools for living more kindly toward them.</b><br><br>In the last few decades, a wealth of new information has emerged about who animals are&#x2014;intelligent, aware, and empathetic. Studies show that animals are astounding beings with intelligence, emotions, intricate communications networks, and myriad abilities. In <i>Animalkind</i>, Ingrid Newkirk and Gene Stone present these findings in a concise and awe-inspiring way, detailing a range of surprising discoveries: that geese fall in love and stay with a partner for life, that fish &#x201c;sing&#x201d; underwater, and that elephants use their trunks to send subsonic signals, alerting other herds to danger miles away.<br> <br>Newkirk and Stone pair their tour of the astounding lives of animals with a guide to the exciting new tools that allow humans to avoid using or abusing animals as we once did. They show readers what they can do in their everyday lives to ensure that the animal world is protected from needless harm. Whether it&#x2019;s medicine, product testing, entertainment, clothing, or food, there are now better options to all the uses animals once served in human life. We can substitute warmer, lighter faux fleece for wool, choose vegan versions of everything from shrimp to sausage and milk to marshmallows, reap the benefits of medical research that no longer requires monkeys to be caged in laboratories, and scrap captive orca exhibits and elephant rides for virtual reality and animatronics.<br> <br><i>Animalkind </i>is a fascinating study of why our fellow living beings deserve our respect, and moreover, the steps every reader can take to put this new understanding into action.</p><p>Ingrid Newkirk founded PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), the largest animal rights organization in the world, with affiliates in eight countries, in 1980.

Claims of being first with any element of the game are disputed with fervor and passion. When the octogenarian Fred Goldsmith died in 1939, a headline proclaimed, 'Goldsmith Dies Insisting He Invented Curve Ball'; Fred Goldsmith understood the secret of immortality. Yet while countless thousands of words have been spilled on the subject of baseball &#x201c;firsts,&#x201d; there has been no definitive source for the settlement of disputes. Peter Morris's endlessly fascinating <i>A Game of Inches</i> has now arrived to fill the void. Impeccably researched and engagingly written, this treasure trove will surprise, delight, and educate even the most knowledgeable fan by dispelling cherished myths and revealing the source of many of baseball's features that we now take for granted. The scope of <i>A Game of Inches</i> is encyclopedic, with nearly a thousand entries that illuminate the origins of items ranging from catchers' masks to hook slides to intentional walks to cork-center baseballs. But this is much more than just a reference guide. Award-winning author Peter Morris explains the context that led each new item to emerge when it did, and chronicles the often surprising responses to these innovations. Of few books can it genuinely be said that once you start reading, it's hard to put it down&#x2015;but <i>A Game of Inches</i> is one of them. It belongs in the pantheon of great baseball books, and will give any reader a deeper appreciation of why baseball matters so much to Americans. (A companion volume, A Game of Inches: The Game Behind the Scenes, was published in the fall of 2006.)</p><p>Peter Morris won the coveted Seymour Medal of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) for his book <i>Baseball Fever</i>, about early baseball in Michigan. He has also been honored by <i>USA Today Sports Weekly</i>. A graduate of the University of Toronto and Michigan State University and a former national and international Scrabble champion, he is now a researcher at the Michigan Public Health Institute and lives in Haslett, Michigan.

But these thrilling, dizzying transformations are forcing the church to decide where it fits in all this progress. Shane Hipps presents the promise and peril of the emerging culture and its relationship to the emerging church. Looking beyond the details of what&#x2019;s happening in communities of faith, Hipps analyzes the broader impact of technology and media on the church while engaging readers with questions such as: � Is media/technology value-neutral? � How has technology changed the way we think about Scripture, community, and worship? � What cultural opportunities has the church missed? � How should the church position itself to take advantage of coming cultural trends? Providing both history and prophecy, The Hidden Power of Electronic Culture invites us to engage new cultural realities while staying connected to our spiritual heritage.</p></p><p>Shane Hipps, teaching pastor at Mars Hill Bible Church, is a dynamic communicator and sought-after speaker.

Creative Team: Carla Barnhill, Kristi Robison, Janie Wilkerson, and Mark Novelli Cover design by Rule29 Printed in the United States A few years after I graduated from college, I became a lay leader at my local church. The pastor invited me to join a &#39;task force&#39; (a sexy name for a committee) that was assembled in order to rethink and revamp our contemporary worship service. At the time we had two services: a traditional service featuring an organist and a full choir leading hymns, and a contemporary service featuring a band leading praise music. Our contemporary service was fl oundering; the attendance was low and the energy lacking. Our discussions as a task force centered on things like the style of worship leading, an inadequate sound system, and poor acoustics. Eventually, these conversations led us to consider the controversial measure of introducing a projection screen. The vast majority of our debate on this issue concerned questions of costs, logistics, and aesthetics. We wondered where the money would come from. Would the screen be obtrusive? Where would we put it? How would the older generation feel about it? These were all valid and important questions, but we began to believe these were not the most important questions for us to ask. &#39;IS TWENTIETH CENTURY MAN ONE WHO RUNS DOWN THE STREET SHOUTING, &#39;I&#39;VE GOT THE ANSWERS. WHAT ARE THE QUESTIONS?&#39;&#39; ---MARSHALL MCLUHAN CHAPTER ONE SEEING BUT NOT PERCEIVING THE HIDDEN POWER OF ELECTRONIC CULTURE Our original reason for considering a projection screen was largely imitative---all good contemporary services have one. But as we worked through the issue, we realized the rationale of &#39;everybody is doing it&#39; was fl awed, and we began exploring different questions: Why do all contemporary services have a screen? What is the effect of using a projection screen versus using a hymnal or bulletin? How would this new form of media alter the congregation&#39;s experience in worship? After some discussion, we came to the conclusion that a screen frees the body from the bulletin or book. It invites movement, dance, and physical expression in worship. It lifts the heads of congregants, amplifying the sound and energy of their voices. We believed all of these were the chief marks of a &#39;good&#39; contemporary service, and they became our guides as we worked to implement this simple change. While this decision was about a relatively minor concern in the life of our church, there was great value in asking this new set of questions. When we considered the broader implications of a seemingly simple decision, it changed the nature of the debate, freed us from our opposing camps, and opened us to better ways of thinking about the rest of the service. Our conversation was in no way unique to that church. Nor did our insights reflect a grand breakthrough in understanding worship technology. But I believe we hit on the fundamental issue of the ways in which media affect the gathered community. Unfortunately, these issues are often only raised---if they are raised at all---when dealing with simple forms such as the projection screen. We seem less interested in asking this question about the more pervasive and complex cultural forces at play both inside and outside of the church. For example, if something as simple as a projection screen can have a dynamic effect on a congregational experience in worship, what happens when more complex media are infused into the life of a church or into the lives of the people who are the church? What is the effect of the Internet on the way we think about and do church? How does the medium of television shape our understanding of community, leadership, and mission? In what ways is our understanding of the gospel altered when we communicate or preach with pictures instead of words? MEDIA: THE CULTURAL ARCHITECT The answers to these questions are based on a simple notion: The forms of media and technology---regardless of their content---cause profound changes in the church and culture. The power of our media forms has created both challenges and opportunities in the ways the people of God are formed. Unfortunately, just as Dorothy and her companions missed the man behind the curtain in The Wizard of Oz, we stand oblivious to the hidden power of media. Most of us point and stare at the giant wizard head wreathed in flame, quite unaware it is only a distraction---the con man&#39;s sleight of hand. The time has come for the church to pull back the curtain and expose the true effects of media. While this may sound like the hunt for some notorious villain, it is not. The media to which I am referring are neither evil nor good. Yet this in no way means they are neutral. Their power is staggering but remains hidden from view. Because we tend to focus our gaze on their content, the forms of media appear only in our peripheral vision. As a result they exert a subtle yet immense power. By exposing their secrets and powers, we restore our ability to predict and perceive the often unintended consequences of using new media and new methods. This understanding of media is crucial to forming God&#39;s people with discernment, authenticity, and faithfulness to the gospel. MR. NO DEPTH PERCEPTION In 1991, Saturday Night Live introduced America to Mr. No Depth Perception, played by Kevin Nealon. The character made only one appearance, but for some reason the sketch left an indelible mark on my memory. The title tells the story: It&#39;s a sketch about an enthusiastic and well-intentioned man who is completely unaware of the fact that he cannot perceive depth or distance in the world. In the sketch, Mr. No Depth Perception is energized by the prospect of going sky-diving. He imagines how thrilling it must be to &#39;pull the rip cord at just the right moment,&#39; only to have his hopes dashed when his wife, for obvious reasons, adamantly refuses to support his eager aspiration. Later he crashes his head through the living room window in a simple attempt to see who is knocking at the door.</p><h2>That&#39;s The Bag I&#39;m In - The Life, Music and Mystery of Fred Neil</h2><p>"FRED NEIL influenced, inspired, and mentored a generation of musicians and songwriters whose names echo in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The philosophical thinking of Aquinas is the result of reason being challenged to relate to many theological conceptions of the Christian tradition. Gilson carefully reviews how Aquinas grapples with the relation itself of faith and reason and continuing through the existence and nature of God and His creation, the world and its creatures, especially human beings with their power of intellect, will, and moral life. He concludes this study by discussing the life of people in society, along with their purpose and final destiny. Gilson demonstrates that Aquinas drew from a wide spectrum of sources in the development of his thought-from the speculations of the ancient Greeks such as Aristotle, to the Arabic and Jewish philosophers of his time, as well as from Christian writers and scripture. <i>The Christian Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas</i> offers students of philosophy and medieval studies an insightful introduction to the thought of Aquinas and the Scholastic philosophy of the Middles Ages, insights that are still revelant for today.</p><p>Etienne Gilson was born in Paris in 1884. He became Professor of Medieval Philosophy at the Sorbonne in 1921, and from 1932 until his retirement in 1951 he held a similar chair at the College de France.

So off they go in search of a new place to live. Sam knows research is key, so he finds books about architectural styles to get ideas for building a temporary home from objects found around the library. They build and live in a variety of houses: a castle, an igloo, a yurt, a modern house, and even a geodesic dome. But none feels like home to Sam. Finally, though, the renovation of the library is complete, and they can move back to their true home, the library!<br> The book includes photos of the real house styles discussed in the text and a relevant glossary of architectural terms.<br> <br> <b>Praise for <i>Library Mouse: Home Sweet Home</i></b><br> "Kirk&#x2019;s familiar gouache illustrations maintain a mouse perspective filled with library details.

After the mouse reads a note indicating that a &#x201c;renovation&#x201d; in his library is afoot, he uses a dictionary to define the new word and then locates architecture resources to help him design temporary quarters in the attic. Sam's cerebral style contrasts with that of his more adventurous friend Sarah. While Sam gravitates toward classical Roman buildings and grand castles, Sarah favors yurts, igloos, and geodesic domes. Seeking a perfect home, the two pals produce many miniature structures. In the end, Sam resides most comfortably under a book, which Sarah presents to him as an example of an A-frame house. Predictably, with the library renovations completed, the children's room re-opens with the mouse projects prominently displayed on the shelf tops, making for a warm, welcoming, and creative environment. Kirk's gouache cartoon illustrations are charming. The back matter includes information on houses around the world, photos, and a glossary.

That itch produced the seventeen stories in this fourth volume. There are tales of Indians and trappers, ghosts and firebirds, sea horses and sand dollars, romance and heartache. Some of the stories tell of eerie and frightening events. Some chronicle the history of the coast and its early inhabitants. Others tease us with the promise of love and happiness, only to end in tragedy and despair. Still others explain the strange habits and appearances of local flora and fauna in ways far more intriguing than the scientists do.</p><p>For decades, the folk tales of Charles Harry Whedbee have been available wherever you care to look on the Outer Banks. Their popularity has transcended Whedbee's loyal readership among North Carolinians and visitors from the Northeast and the Midwest. Charles Harry Whedbee was an elected judge in his native Greenville, North Carolina, for thirty-plus years, but his favorite place was the Outer Banks, Nags Head in particular. Whedbee was the author of the five folklore collections listed below. He died in 1990. In 2004, the staff of John F. Blair, Publisher, collected 13 of Judge Whedbee's finest stories for the volume titled&nbsp;Pirates, Ghosts, and Coastal Lore. If this is your introduction to Charles Harry Whedbee, you'll soon understand his love for the people and the history of the Outer Banks.</p><h2>Cool Copper Cuffs: 25 metal and wire projects</h2><p>Copper is affordable, plentiful and easy to work with.

Kristiana von Lange, an Austrian countess once linked romantically with Emily's fianc�, the debonair Colin Hargreaves, is a guest also.

I was convinced from an early age that I was born in the wrong century and spent much of my childhood under the dining room table pretending it was a covered wagon. Even there, I was never without a book in hand and loved reading and history more than anything. I studied English Literature and Medieval History at the University of Notre Dame. Writing is a natural offshoot of reading, and my first novel,&nbsp;<i>And Only to Deceive</i>, was published in 2005. I'm the New York Times Bestselling author of the long-running Lady Emily Series as well as the novel&nbsp;<i>Elizabeth: The Golden Age</i>. One of the best parts of being an author is seeing your books translated, and I'm currently in love with the Japanese editions of the Emily books.&nbsp;<br><br><br>I played nomad for a long time, living in Indiana, Amsterdam, London, Wyoming, Vermont, Connecticut, and Tennessee before settling down. My husband, the brilliant British novelist&nbsp;Andrew Grant&nbsp;(I may be biased but that doesn't mean I'm wrong) and I now divide our time between Chicago and Wyoming. He makes sure I get my English characters right, and I make sure his American ones sound American.In Alexander's charming third novel of romantic suspense set in late Victorian England (after <i>The Poisoned Season</i>), Lady Emily Ashton is at a country house party when someone shoots her noxious host, Lord Basil Fortescue, with a dueling pistol. After the husband of a good friend is accused of the murder, Emily determines to find the real killer. The only clue, a threatening letter promising a political assassination, drives Emily to Vienna, where she meets the painter Gustav Klimt and shares stolen moments with her fianc�, diplomat Colin Hargreaves. But Emily never forgets her urgent mission&#x2014;in the service of which she must match wits with double agents and anarchists as well as ally herself temporarily with Colin's former lover, the sexually sophisticated Kristiana von Lange. The appealing Emily at times comes across as too modern for even the most unconventional Victorian character, and the plot sags in mid-story despite several clever subplots.

Set in New York&#x2019;s Lower East Side of the 1980s and mid-1990s, it is also a devastatingly candid look at the extreme naivet� and dysfunction that would destroy both their lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> Escaping the trauma of growing up gay in Syracuse and being bullied at school, McGough attended art school in New York, dropped out, and took out jobs in clubs, where he met McDermott. Dazzled by McDermott, whom he found fascinating and worldly, McGough agreed to collaborate with him not only on their art but also in McDermott&#x2019;s very entertaining Victorian lifestyle. McGough evokes the rank and seedy East Village of that time, where he encountered Keith Haring, Rene Ricard, Kenny Scharf, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol, and Jacqueline and Julian Schnabel, among many others. Nights were spent at the Ninth Circle, Danceteria, and Studio 54; going to openings at the FUN Gallery; or visiting friends in the Chelsea Hotel. By the mid-1980s, McDermott &amp; McGough were hugely successful, showing at three Whitney Biennials, represented by the best galleries here and abroad, and known for their painting, photography and &#x201c;time experiment&#x201d; interiors. Then, overnight, it was all gone. And one day in the mid-1990s, McGough would find that he, like so many of his friends, had been diagnosed with AIDS.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>I&#x2019;ve Seen the Future and I&#x2019;m Not Going </i>is a compelling memoir for our time, told with humor and compassion, about how lives can become completely entwined even in failure and what it costs to reemerge, phoenix-like, and carry on.</p><p><b>PETER McGOUGH</b> is an artist who has collaborated with David McDermott since 1980 as McDermott &amp; McGough. They are known for their work in painting and photography. McGough divides his time between Dublin and New York City.<b>Prologue</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The worst part of being sick, truly sick, was the night. I&#x2019;d shoot awake from a searing pain that started in my toe and ran right up the inside of my leg. Within seconds my whole limb was on fire. After about twenty minutes, the pain would subside, but now I was wide awake. I&#x2019;d lived in Manhattan for most of my adult life, but until I was up nightly, I had never realized how quiet Times Square could be at three in the morning: a stillness that left me defenseless against the crushing thoughts of the past and its glory, and of my present dire circumstances.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was 1998, I was on the good side of forty, and I was almost dead. Paul Bellman, my doctor, the man who was known for pulling patients off the edge of doom, later told me that when he saw me for the first time, he thought, &#x201c;This person has three months to live.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t know it, but his treatment plan wasn&#x2019;t to cure me, which looked impossible even to a man considered one of the best AIDS doctors in the world; his plan was simply to make me comfortable in my final weeks.<br> &nbsp;<br> A few friends and ex-assistants came to visit. I could tell by their startled faces I must have looked a wreck. I was a skeletal one hundred pounds, covered from head to toe in purple, AIDS-related Kaposi&#x2019;s sarcoma sores, with my once thick mane of blond hair now wispy and thin. I greeted my guests in a frayed nightshirt as I sank into a foot-high feather mattress in my antique brass bed, made for McDermott and me by Iskobel Iskowitz, where I spent my days and sleepless nights. The bed was one of the few remnants from my days of grandeur.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even if I wanted to leave my apartment&#x2014;which I rarely did&#x2014;I could barely manage the stairs. Without savings or livelihood, I was living in the only place I could afford: a glorified attic, five crooked flights of stairs above Forty-Sixth Street in Midtown Manhattan&#x2014;&#x201c;Little Brazil&#x201d;&#x2014;in a slanting nineteenth-century town house. And, for the first time in my adult life, I was living alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Only a few blocks away from the stone lions of the stately New York Public Library, the street floor of this once grand house was now a Japa�nese restaurant for the lunchtime business crowd. From my sickbed at night I could hear the rats fighting over the scraps of mid-priced sushi in the back garden. The second floor had a Brazilian hair salon that specialized in bikini waxing. The sexy Latino proprietor would stand in the window with his uniform of skintight black jeans and a form-fitting dark T-shirt, overseeing the needs of his clients and his coterie of beau�tiful assistants. The third floor was an &#x201c;Asian Beauties&#x201d; massage parlor. I painted a sign and taped it to my door that read, WHORES ON 3RD FLOOR! DON&#x2019;T BOTHER TO KNOCK!, to stop the familiar, soft tapping from their late-night clientele. After a raid closed the massage parlor I broke the police lock and chain on the door to see what was there. The Victorian ornament around the ceiling, now crumbling, was painted black like the walls and the indoor/outdoor&#x2013;upholstered cube where clients waited for attention. I peeked into the sad little single rooms where men would get massaged. As though frozen in time after the raid, there were still large plastic bottles of economy-sized body lotion and rumpled sheets. At the end of the hallway was a washer/dryer that had stopped in midwash amongst a pile of dirty sex towels. A bok choy dish was still on a dirty hot plate, and melted votive candles were strewn about the soggy-carpeted floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Above this pleasure palace, on the fourth floor lived a thin, pale art�ist, Chivas Clem, who had told my friend Jane Rosenblum about the apartment. I could always tell when it was eleven a.m. because his alarm clock would ring for an hour while he was in deep, medicated slumber. Chivas was the director of the Pat Hearn art gallery, aka PHAG, in Chelsea. It was one of the first three galleries to move from SoHo to Chelsea, along with Matthew Marks and Morris-Healy. I showed with Pat in the eighties when she was in the East Village. After Pat&#x2019;s death in 2000 her husband, Colin de Land, took over the gallery space.<br> &nbsp;<br> Chivas&#x2019;s apartment also doubled as a gallery he called &#x201c;the Fifth International,&#x201d; where he put on exhibitions. One evening Chivas heard me in the hallway and invited me in for a drink. I noticed the remains of drugs on an overturned <i>Artforum </i>magazine with an ad for my former Swiss art dealer, Bruno Bischofberger. Chivas was just finishing dinner with two young artists on the rise, Rob Pruitt and Elizabeth Peyton. I stayed a bit to be polite and begged forgiveness for leaving so soon. I couldn&#x2019;t bear how embarrassed I felt about how far I had fallen and that my looks foretold how ill I was.<br> &nbsp;<br> In my fifth-floor apartment above Chivas I had a kitchen and three large rooms which I painted in blue, green, and white to hide the cracks and cheap plaster repairs. I didn&#x2019;t have any furniture but my bed, so I borrowed two rooms of antique furniture from my friend Ricky Clifton who was decorating artists&#x2019; apartments. I promised to buy them but kept putting him off because I could barely make the rent. I set up a white-walled painting studio in the front parlor with the easel and art supplies my friend Walter Fleming bought me and where&#x2014;when I had the strength to get out of bed and my bedroom&#x2014;I started to paint again. The rest of the time I painted from my bed, finishing watercolors for a show in Paris.<br> &nbsp;<br> My bedroom was in the back, where I could see a jeweler (the Dia�mond District was the next block) working diligently through the night, his room illuminated by the blue flames of his trade. My friend Mary Bertold from FIT was so horrified after seeing where I lived and how I looked that she bought me a small refrigerator, which she had her friend Liz drag up the five flights so I could keep food there. Mary would burst into tears with each visit or phone call. A lot of people cried when they visited. I felt terrible that I upset them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How the hell did I end up here?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d sigh at night as the fumes of burning flesh filled the apartment from the fast-food burger place below. I had watched so many friends die miserable deaths from AIDS and now my number was up. I felt damned and cursed. As I passed people on the streets I wanted to change lives with any of them. I&#x2019;d take their lot. Anything was better than this death sentence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Only a little more than a decade before, in 1986 a painting I made with my partner, David McDermott, was on the cover of <i>Artforum</i>, at the time the international bible of the art world; and in 1993, a picture of us and our assistants in our studio was the cover of <i>Art in America</i>. We had sold-out shows in the best galleries in New York and Europe and endless invitations to museum openings, art parties, society events, and movie premieres. Our life was seemingly a never-ending one of fame and luxury.<br> &nbsp;<br> After the financial crash in 1987 we lost our 1840s town house on Avenue C in the East Village, lit by candlelight and heated by fires in the hearths. We had filled the two floors above an old storefront with mid-nineteenth-century antique furnishings right down to the drinking glasses. Our mattresses were foot-high striped ticking, fluffed into mountains full of feathers. We covered the cracked walls in period papers and hung vintage prints, paintings, and mirrors for our nineteenth-century &#x201c;time experiment.&#x201d; Every object had to fit perfectly&#x2014;no modern element was allowed there, not even a telephone. As a part of our time machine, we wore detachable starched collars and cuffs, high-button-shoes, silk top hats and capes, and carried walking sticks&#x2014;among our vast period wardrobe.<br> &nbsp;<br> We also lost our studio in 1994 which had been the Kings County Savings Bank, an intact 1865 three-story Second Empire limestone building on the corner of Broadway and Bedford Avenue in Williams�burg, Brooklyn. We had acquired it in 1989, decades before the arrival of frat boys and Wall Street financiers. The bank&#x2019;s first floor housed our offices that we furnished with period manual typewriters, candlestick telephones, and oak office furniture, all under a grand ceiling lit by six hanging cast-iron early electroliers. At noon each day a chef would arrive with a vegetarian lunch to feed the staff. Our British secretary, Jane, also wore period antique clothes. We forbade our studio assistants to wear printed T-shirts and had them wear smocks while they worked, to cover their modern dress. The second floor was our sun-filled paint�ing studio, with many assistants stretching and preparing the canvases. And above that was our photography studio, with a twenty-three-foot-high ceiling and pumpkin-colored walls piled high with our antique props, period costumes, and large wooden view cameras. There we pub�lished the one issue of our magazine, <i>The Cottage, Protector of Hearth and Home, </i>and had it printed in New York with a hand-set letterpress.<br> &nbsp;<br> But perhaps what I missed the most was our &#x201c;miniature mansion,&#x201d; as we called it: an untouched brick house from 1790 with no heating, plumbing, or electricity. The only heat source was the fireplaces, where we cooked our meals, and the water was from a hand-pump well out�side the kitchen door. The house was next to an 1880s general store with an apartment above it and a Greek Revival two-seater outhouse with wallpapered walls. It was set among tree-shaded barns and a carriage house alongside a flowing stream in Oak Hill, in the Catskills.<br> &nbsp;<br> We also gave up our 1913 crank Model T Ford touring car, our 1926 Model A truck, and a plush navy-colored 1930 Graham-Paige luxury car with silk window shades, a bud vase, and a brass blanket bar for the backseat. Not to mention our horses, carriages, handmade saddles and riding boots. After the IRS seized our property, they had a three-day auction in Albany of all the antique furnishings of the house, the general store, the apartment above it and the contents of the barns. I begged the local antiques dealers, whom I knew well, and those who came from far and wide, not to bid against us, so I could buy back the contents of my life. My pleas fell on deaf ears. The highest bidders left with our furnishings, eighteenth-century clothes, carriages, and an 1880s wooden, horse-drawn omnibus with a Hudson River scene painted on the side which held eighteen passengers. All that remained were our feather mattresses and a few old American flags since they couldn&#x2019;t sell them legally. I had to remind them of that fact.<br> &nbsp;<br> McDermott departed for Ireland in the summer of 1994, on the <i>QE2 </i>with a one-way ticket his grandmother bought him, saying he wanted to live in a country that protected its artists. At that point Irish artists didn&#x2019;t have to pay taxes. I thought he&#x2019;d return after a year, but he didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;and that was how years later I found myself living alone in a fifth-floor walkup off Times Square, trying to stay alive and revive our floundering career.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If only I had kept McDermott under control,&#x201d; I uttered to no one.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Power of Integrity: Building a Life Without Compromise</h2><p>Provides a call for Christians to maintain a commitment to integrity, no matter what the cost</p><p><p><strong>John MacArthur</strong> is the pastor-teacher of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California, where he has served since 1969.

Will they judge you as a rank-and-file associate or a potential leader?<br>The answer is often determined by the first impressions you make. And it doesn&#x2019;t matter whether you are the world&#x2019;s most productive, intelligent new professional&#x2014;if you are perceived differently, your career will suffer. <br><br>1&nbsp; /&nbsp; Conquer Your First Day <br>Here we are, folks: the first day. And right now, you are under the microscope. Since your supervisors can&#x2019;t judge you on performance and contributions yet, the focus will be on filling out piles of paperwork, getting you situated, and integrating you into the team. But make no mistake, <i>you are being judged</i>.<br><br>However, instead of the usual measures that will kick in once you&#x2019;re settled into the position, you will be judged on some very visible, basic parameters:<br><br>� Did you show up on time?<br>� What are you wearing?<br>� Do you display confidence and charisma?<br>� Do you seem overwhelmed or ready for a challenge?<br>� How well do you communicate?<br>� What personal items did you put in your office?<br><br>On the first day, your mission is simple: Make a positive first impression. And the way to do that is to be very <i>intentional</i> about how you present yourself. Here are some tips that will help you not merely survive your first day, but conquer it with poise and professionalism. <br><br>Arrive Early<br>Make sure you are on-site at least ten to fifteen minutes before your official start time. If your commute involves driving or taking public transportation, consider rehearsing your route in advance. (Try to go when travel conditions are as realistic as possible; for instance, don&#x2019;t make the drive on a Sunday afternoon if you&#x2019;ll be traveling during weekday morning rush hour.) Giving yourself a bit of extra time will not only create some leeway if there are any unexpected delays (traffic, parking, and so on), but will also let you step into the restroom and collect yourself once you arrive. You&#x2019;ll be understandably nervous, so don&#x2019;t let normal first-day jitters spiral into outright panic by getting behind schedule. <br><br>Look the Part <br>The saying &#x201c;Dress for the job you want, not the one you have&#x201d; applies from your very first day at work. While every office is different and some are more casual than others, a good rule of thumb is to dress a notch above your current station. For most new employees, this means donning a high-quality, conservative suit that&#x2019;s pressed and spotless, wearing shoes that are polished, and carrying a leather (or faux leather) briefcase or messenger bag. To save time on your big day, have your outfit ready the night before. Also, don&#x2019;t forget to bring a pack of breath mints. Even the sharpest suit can be forgotten next to someone who smells like day-old Starbucks. <br><br>Exude Confidence<br>This is truly a crossroads in your life and the first step to building an extraordinary career. You&#x2019;re earning your own money now, and there&#x2019;s no limit to what you can achieve. Regardless of your past work or life experiences, this is an opportunity to start fresh and turn the page. Embrace it and walk tall. <br><br>Take Initiative <br>A great way to come across as friendly and confident right away is to proactively introduce yourself to your new colleagues. Don&#x2019;t assume they should reach out to you first because it&#x2019;s their workplace already. Just extend a firm handshake, smile warmly, and have some fifteen-second &#x201c;about me&#x201d; sound bites ready. Take some time beforehand to think about the questions you are likely to be asked and be prepared with insightful, succinct responses. In fact, we&#x2019;ll make it easy&#x2014;you&#x2019;re probably going to be asked about: <br><br>� Your university (and its latest football record)<br>� Your major<br>� Your professors (if you encounter any alumni)<br>� Your hometown<br>� Your current role (&#x201c;So, you&#x2019;re our new associate, eh?&#x201d;)<br>� Your tasks (If you don&#x2019;t yet know what types of projects you&#x2019;ll be assigned, just smile and say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure exactly what I&#x2019;ll be working on yet, but I&#x2019;m looking <br>forward to getting started.&#x201d;)<br><br>Also, since you&#x2019;re going to be doing lots of introductions, come up with some questions for your coworkers so the conversation is a dialogue rather than a Q &amp; A session. You can research key players online via the company website, Google, or LinkedIn, but if all else fails, look around their office for clues on topics of interest. For example, if the walls are dripping with plaques, comment on one. If their desk is filled with family photos, ask about their children. <br><br>The point here is to realize that the impressions you&#x2019;re making on the job don&#x2019;t have to be left to chance. In PR, they call this &#x201c;controlling the message.&#x201d; You can call it being <i>effective immediately</i>. Are you ready? Welcome to the workforce!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Newbie to Newbie</b><br><b>Leave the Sequins and Pleather at Home</b><br>My first real job was for a company owned by the world&#x2019;s largest fashion conglomerate and located in America&#x2019;s fashion capital, New York City. I figured I had &#x201c;made it&#x201d; and needed to look the part. I researched all of the major fashion magazines for the latest trends and developed a work wardrobe of gold pleather pants, brightly colored tops, and excessive chunky jewelry. I even took a day-to-night approach by wearing a sequined tank that would look great after work and toning it down for the office by pairing it with simple black pants. It only took a short time to notice that no one else in the office was wearing sequins or gold pants, and that I had mistaken trendy looks from the magazines&#x2019; pages for chic business attire. I realized then that if I wanted to be treated like a professional, I had to dress accordingly.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nicole Lemoine<br>Public educator <br>New York, New York<br>&nbsp;<br>2&nbsp; /&nbsp; Have Patience <br>Fresh out of college, many newbies think that because of their education they have immediate status and deserve lofty positions. Not so. Status is the result of accomplishment, which is the result of work. Hard, often tedious work. <br><br>Any time you are a new hire, and especially at the beginning of your career, you must build your own success from the ground up. Do not expect anyone to assume you&#x2019;re talented. You have to show them&#x2014;and this takes time. Usually more time than you expect. <br><br>So be patient. Don&#x2019;t focus on when you&#x2019;re going to move up; focus on what you&#x2019;re doing now. As Sir William Osler (a pioneer of modern medicine) stated, &#x201c;The best preparation for tomorrow is to do today&#x2019;s work superbly well.&#x201d; If at the end of each workday you can truthfully say that you worked to the best of your ability, we guarantee your success will take care of itself. <br><br>3&nbsp; /&nbsp; Mind Your &#x201c;-Ilities&#x201d; <br>To: Entry-Level Associates<br>From: The Boss<br>Re: Mind Your &#x201c;-Ilities&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Management would like to take this opportunity to welcome all of you aboard. We are thrilled that you have chosen to work for our organization, and we know that you will be a great asset to the team. <br><br>Having said that, we would also like you to be aware that all respective department heads are now actively scouting for the company&#x2019;s next &#x201c;young guns.&#x201d; And while other newbies will have orientation as usual (that is, they&#x2019;ll be given the tour and then left alone), young guns will be handpicked for the fast track. They will be carefully groomed for big chairs in the executive suite and will be first in line for promotions, top projects, personal attention, and other perks. <br><br>If you want to become a member of the club, management recommends that you stack the odds in your favor by minding your &#x201c;-ilities&#x201d; (dependability, reliability, humility, accountability, responsibility, likeability, punctuality, and so on). Until we&#x2019;ve had enough time to sufficiently evaluate the caliber of your work, our first impressions of you will be based on perceptible qualities, like &#x201c;-ilities,&#x201d; we can see for ourselves. Just thought you should know. <br>&nbsp;<br>Sincerely, <br>The Boss <br><br>4&nbsp; /&nbsp; Prepare for the Brain Dump<br>Fact: When you&#x2019;re new, you&#x2019;re going to be overwhelmed. Everyone who seemingly knows everything about your office and its customers is going to randomly &#x201c;dump&#x201d; this knowledge on you in rapid, shotgun-like outbursts. Usually these brain dumps occur in stream-of-consciousness statements that begin on your first day, often before you&#x2019;ve had a chance to locate the coffee maker. (&#x201c;Ann will be your main client contact, but she&#x2019;s out of the office on Tuesdays and every other Thursday. Here&#x2019;s the supply closet; if you can&#x2019;t find something here, there&#x2019;s another located on the fifth floor. There are separate recycling containers for paper, cardboard, glass, and plastic&#x2014;and all paper recyclables must be totally staple-free. What were we talking about a minute ago?&#x201d;)<br><br>It&#x2019;s a lot to take in at once, but rest assured, the brain dump happens to everyone. Prepare yourself by knowing that you <i>will</i> be bombarded with new people and new information coming at you from every direction. However, there are a few things you can do to manage the flow.<br><br>Study Your Business<br>In your first few days on the job, carve out some time to research everything you can about your company and how it operates. Explore your website, read your organization&#x2019;s marketing brochures, annual reports, and proposals. Without breaching security policies, search around the intranet and read any reports, timelines, work plans, and other relevant documents you can find. Copy the best of these to your desktop, then format your work to look similar. This background will most likely answer a lot of the more basic questions that every new employee asks, so you can stand out with more targeted, insightful observations.<br><br>But Do Ask Questions&#x2014;Even Basic Ones <br>When you&#x2019;re new, you have about a two-week grace period in which coworkers will cheerfully answer any inane question you throw at them. Take advantage of this time now and use it to your benefit. Later on, they may not be so charitable. <br><br>Get Organized<br>When it comes to taking notes, it&#x2019;s critical to keep everything in one place. Therefore you&#x2019;ll want to carry your planner or a notebook with you at all times&#x2014;you never know when the next brain dump will take place. (See pages 22&#x2013;23 for some note-taking tips.) Also, if you work at a job where you&#x2019;re responsible for multiple projects at the same time, start a new page for each one. This will give you space to go back and add notes as needed.<br><br>Stay Sane<br>Never allow the brain dump to visibly stress you out. Remember, people are still forming impressions of you at this point; if you can&#x2019;t handle the first week without being completely overwhelmed, they&#x2019;re naturally going to wonder whether you&#x2019;re cut out for the job. In truth, brain dumps usually occur because most of your colleagues haven&#x2019;t thought much about your arrival before you showed up, so they&#x2019;re just spouting information as it comes to them. At the end of the day, take as many notes as you can, smile often, and know that in a few months you will be brain dumping on the next wide-eyed newbie&#x2014;just remember to let them have some coffee first. <br>&nbsp;<br>5&nbsp; /&nbsp; Don&#x2019;t Expect a Lot of Hand-Holding <br>Regardless of where you work or what industry you&#x2019;re in, there are certain processes, tools, and forms that make up the standard operating procedures of your company. Perhaps you were introduced to these through a very organized, systematic orientation. If so, great&#x2014;consider yourself fortunate. If not, don&#x2019;t feel shortchanged or frustrated. Instead, take initiative and master the basics on your own. <br><br>In decades past, when most people worked for huge corporations, the training process for newcomers was given greater attention. Fully staffed human resource departments handled orientation, or mid-level managers or supervisors were responsible for getting new hires up to speed. <br><br>Today, things are different. Companies have pared back layers of management and administrative functions to become leaner and more competitive. Traditional HR departments are either gone or spread thin. In addition, the world is becoming increasingly populated by small businesses, many of which have not yet developed structured processes for training new employees. As a result, basic procedures like orientation get less direct attention. (And this trend is not likely to reverse.)<br><br>So don&#x2019;t wait for orientation to come to you. Go out and tackle it yourself. Ask your colleagues for help. (Be patient and persistent, though; providing this information may not be anyone&#x2019;s direct responsibility.) The following chapter includes lists of questions that are typically addressed during more formal orientations.</p><h2>Algebra: Chapter 0 (Graduate Studies in Mathematics)</h2><p>Algebra: Chapter 0 is a self-contained introduction to the main topics of algebra, suitable for a first sequence on the subject at the beginning graduate or upper undergraduate level. The primary distinguishing feature of the book, compared to standard textbooks in algebra, is the early introduction of categories, used as a unifying theme in the presentation of the main topics. A second feature consists of an emphasis on homological algebra: basic notions on complexes are presented as soon as modules have been introduced, and an extensive last chapter on homological algebra can form the basis for a follow-up introductory course on the subject. Approximately 1,000 exercises both provide adequate practice to consolidate the understanding of the main body of the text and offer the opportunity to explore many other topics, including applications to number theory and algebraic geometry. This will allow instructors to adapt the textbook to their specific choice of topics and provide the independent reader with a richer exposure to algebra. Many exercises include substantial hints, and navigation of the topics is facilitated by an extensive index and by hundreds of cross-references.</p><p>This self-contained introduction is suitable for a first sequence at the beginning graduate or upper undergraduate level.

Organized into three parts, the text begins with advocacy in the field of early childhood education, discusses how to develop an advocacy agenda, and concludes with becoming an advocate for life. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Additionally, the author outlines six contexts for advocacy in the field of early childhood -- individual child and family, advocacy for the profession, program-based advocacy, private-sector advocacy, political activism, and advocacy in the global arena. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p> <i>Informed Advocacy in Early Childhood Care and Education: Making a Difference for Young Children and Families </i>deconstructs the myth that advocacy is something done by someone else, or only by someone at state or national levels of government.&nbsp; Rather, advocacy is a skill and responsibility to be practiced at the local level by any and all of us.&nbsp; It discusses contexts of advocacy for young children and their families, beginning locally and working outwardly to global advocacy, and provides specific guidelines for developing an advocacy agenda.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This book discusses a wide range of advocacy activities, including</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; becoming an&nbsp; informed advocate,</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; choosing effective strategies, </p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; networking, </p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; advocating for program changes from within,</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; navigating and being effective in the political process, </p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; working with the private sector to bring about positive changes for children,</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; developing and managing an advocacy agenda, and </p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; working with the media.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It is practical enough for individual use by in-service early childhood professionals, yet robust enough for college courses.&nbsp; </p> <p> </p></p><h2>The Case Against Standardized Testing: Raising the Scores, Ruining the Schools</h2><p>Our students are tested to an extent that is unprecedented in American history and unparalleled anywhere in the world. Politicians and businesspeople, determined to get tough with students and teachers, have increased the pressure to raise standardized test scores. Unfortunately, the effort to do so typically comes at the expense of more meaningful forms of learning. <p> That disturbing conclusion emerges from Alfie Kohn's devastating new indictment of standardized testing. Drawing from the latest research, he concisely explains just how little test results really tell us and just how harmful a test-driven curriculum can be. Written in a highly readable question-and-answer format, <i>The Case Against Standardized Testing</i> will help readers respond to common questions and challenges-showing, for example, that: </p><ul> <li>high scores often signify relatively superficial thinking </li><li>many of the leading tests were never intended to measure teaching or learning </li><li>a school that improves its test results may well have lowered its standards to do so </li><li>far from helping to "close the gap," the use of standardized testing is most damaging for low-income and minority students </li><li>as much as 90 percent of the variations in test scores among schools or states have nothing to do with the quality of instruction </li><li>far more meaningful measures of student learning-or school quality-are available. </li></ul> Kohn's central message is that standardized tests are "not like the weather, something to which we must resign ourselves. . . . They are not a force of nature but a force of politics-and political decisions can be questioned, challenged, and ultimately reversed." The final section demonstrates how teachers, parents, and students can turn their frustration into action and successfully turn back the testing juggernaut in order to create classrooms that focus on learning.<p></p> <p> Also available on Audiotape: <i>The Case Against Standardized Testing: Raising the Scores, Ruining the Schools</i>, read by Alfie Kohn.</p></p><p><p>Alfie Kohn was recently described by Time magazine as "perhaps the country's most outspoken critic of education's fixation on grades [and] test scores." He is the author of 13 books on education and human behavior, including The Schools Our Children Deserve, The Case Against Standardized Testing, and The Homework Myth. A former teacher, Kohn now works with educators across the country and speaks regularly at national conferences. He lives (actually) in Belmont, Mass. and (virtually) at www.alfiekohn.org.</p>&#x201c;The more we learn about standardized testing.the more likely we are to be appalled.

The book starts with what it means to be a critical and uncritical reader of research, followed by a detailed chapter on methodology, and then proceeds to a discussion of each component of a research article as it is informed by the methodology. The book encourages readers to select an article from their discipline, learning along the way how to assess each component of the article and come to a judgment of its rigor or quality as a scholarly report.</p></p><p><p>&nbsp;Dr. Sue L.

She took a creative and systematic stand on the major questions of philosophy of mind, epistemology, metaphysics, and political philosophy. She argued that human beings and all other members of the created universe are purely material creatures, and she held that there are many other ways in which creatures are alike as well: for example, human beings, non-human animals, spiders, cells, and all other beings exhibit skill, wisdom, and activity, and so the universe of matter is not the largely dead and unimpressive region that most of her contemporaries thought it to be. Creatures instead are sophisticated and display a wide spectrum of intelligent activity, ranging from the highly conscious mentality that Descartes posited to be part and parcel of human thought, to embodied forms of cognition that is more common in non-human creatures but that guide a significant portion of human behavior as well. Cavendish then used her fictional work to further illustrate her views and arguments, and also to craft alternative fictional worlds in which the climate for women was very different than on Seventeenth-Century earth - a climate in which women could be taken seriously in the role of philosopher, writer, scientist, military general, and other roles. <br><br>This is the first volume to provide a cross-section of Cavendish's writings, views and arguments, along with introductory material. It excerpts the key portions of all her texts including annotated notes highlighting the interconnections between them. Including a general introduction by Cunning, the book will allow students to work toward a systematic picture of Cavendish's metaphysics, epistemology, and political philosophy (and including some of her non-philosophical work as well) and to see her in dialogue with philosophers who are part of the traditional canon.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Cunning</strong> is Professor of Philosophy and Collegiate Scholar at the University of Iowa, where he is also Chair of the Philosophy Department.

This engaging text provides an effective process for studying multiple cases--such as sets of teachers, staff development sessions, or clinics operating in different locations--within one complex program. The process also can be used to investigate broadly occurring phenomena without programmatic links, such as leadership or sibling rivalry. Readers learn to design, analyze, and report studies that balance common issues across the group of cases with the unique features and context of each case. Three actual case reports from a transnational early childhood program illustrate the author's approach, and helpful reproducible worksheets facilitate multicase recording and analysis. <br></p><p>Robert E.

While the Critique of Pure Reason offers the foundation for his theories of knowledge and reality and the manner in which we come to possess ideas about the world, Kant&#39;s Critique of Practical Reason shows how these mental processes are linked - how the mind moves from a formal understanding of reasoning in general to moral reasoning in particular.</p><h2>Through the Lens of Anthropology: An Introduction to Human Evolution and Culture, Second Edition</h2><p><p><em>Through the Lens of Anthropology</em> is a concise introduction to anthropology that uses the twin themes of food and sustainability to illustrate the connected nature of the discipline&#x2019;s many subfields.

Born in Paris in 1947, Redonnet taught for a number of years in a suburban <i>lyc�e</i> before deciding to pursue a writing career full time. Since her volume of poetry <i>Le Mort &amp; Cie</i> appeared in 1985, she has published four novels, a novella, numerous short stories, and three dramatic works. <p>In translator Jordan Stump's words, these three novels, "unmistakably fit together, although they have neither characters nor setting in common. Redonnet sees the three novels as a triptych: each panel stands alone, and yet all coalesce to form a whole." Each is narrated by a different woman. <i>H�tel Splendid </i>recounts the daily life of three sisters who live in a decrepit hotel on the edge of a swamp; <i>Forever Valley </i>is about&nbsp;a sixteen-year-old girl who works in a dance-hall and looks for the dead; <i>Rose Mellie Rose</i> is the story of another adolescent girl who assembles a photographic and written record of her life in the dying town of �at.</p><p>Redonnet's novels have been compared to those of Annie Ernaux, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Samuel Beckett. She has since acknowledged the crucial influence which Beckett's work has had upon her literary work. And yet she is also notably different from the great master of modern literature. "Where Beckett's characters slide almost inevitably toward extinction, resignation, and silence," Stump points out, "Redonnet's display a force for life and creation that borders on the triumphant. . . . [They] retain even in the darkest situations a remarkable persistence, openness, and above all hope, a hope that may well be, however unspectacularly, repaid in the end."</p></p><p>Hotel Splendid recounts the daily lives of three sisters who live in a decrepit hotel on the edge of the swamp. The narrator, the youngest of the sisters, struggles to preserve the hotel in the face of insurmountable dilemmas: the decay of the building, the indifference and illness of her sisters, the remorseless expansion of the swamp. Confronted with dissolution and death, she displays a tireless persistence that is nearly as mysterious as it is moving.Jordan Stump is an assistant professor of French at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.</p><h2>The Gettysburg Cyclorama: The Turning Point of the Civil War on Canvas</h2><p>Thousands of books and articles have been written about the Battle of Gettysburg.

Thomas[1], is an excellent source of information.&nbsp; However, since it was written in 1989, it does not cover many of the new discoveries that were made during the restoration that took place from 2003 to 2008.&nbsp; The pictures in the book are rather small and show the painting in its deteriorated condition. To address some of the newer discoveries, Sue Boardman and Kathryn Porch wrote <i>The Battle of Gettysburg Cyclorama, A History and Guide </i>in 2008.[2]&nbsp;&nbsp; This admirable book contains many new discoveries that were made during the restoration of the Gettysburg Cyclorama.&nbsp; This book also contains updated pictures of the cyclorama in its restored condition.&nbsp; While <i>A History and Guide</i> (which we will refer to as <i>BGC/AHG</i>) is very good, there are still many more aspects of the cyclorama painting that I felt were worth exploring.&nbsp; In 2011, I met with Sue Boardman and we decided to write a more detailed exploration of the cyclorama painting.&nbsp; Some of our reasons for writing this book are detailed below.&nbsp; <br> <ol><li>Interest in the Gettysburg cyclorama has increased since 2008, when the fully restored painting opened in the new Gettysburg Military Park Visitors Center.&nbsp; Before the restoration, the painting was not nearly as impressive as it is today.&nbsp; The painting was so dark and damaged that even objects in the foreground were distorted, let alone extremely distant objects. Now that the painting has been restored, many of the details are once again visible, and modern photography allows us to see with great clarity distant objects that are barely visible with the naked eye.&nbsp; </li><li>The efforts of the National Park Service (NPS) over the past 20 years to restore the landscape to its 1863 appearance have opened up vistas that are very similar to the views in the painting.&nbsp; </li><li>In order to help plan his great work, the artist came to Gettysburg and paid local photographer William Tipton to take a series of landscape photographs.&nbsp; The Tipton photographs were reproduced in this book for several reasons.&nbsp; First, the Tipton photographs are important documents of the early appearance of the battlefield, and are important for that reason alone.&nbsp; Second, the process of photographing the landscape was an important part of the creation of the cyclorama.&nbsp; Finally, as noted above, the battlefield currently has very similar foliage to what can be seen in the Tipton photographs.&nbsp; With the advantages of modern digital photography, we are able to examine distant objects and document their location in the painting.&nbsp; </li><li>When the four versions of the Gettysburg cyclorama opened in Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and New York, viewers could buy souvenir programs that contained a key.&nbsp; The key was a circular drawing that denoted various people and objects in the paintings.&nbsp; Some of the descriptions would be changed to market the paintings to the local crowds. No one has ever tried to go through all of the historic program keys to identify every named object in the painting until now.&nbsp; These early programs are historic documents.&nbsp; They show us how the painting and the battle have been interpreted during different time periods (and even in different cities).&nbsp; </li><li>New discoveries have been made about the painting. By using modern and historic photography, the authors have identified many new people and places in the painting.&nbsp; We have also discovered more information about some of the men that helped paint the cyclorama, and the entire process of creating a cyclorama. This book is meant to expand upon the information in <i>BGC/AHG</i>, and cover some new discoveries that were made after 2008.&nbsp; </li><li>The painting is so massive and awe-inspiring that the authors thought a book with large pictures would be a great way to explore the painting at one's own pace.&nbsp; Close-up photographs will allow the reader to examine the intricate details of the painting.&nbsp; The authors also hope that readers take the book to the battlefield and compare the painting with the actual terrain.</li></ol> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Photography is a major element of the creation of a cyclorama, and our study of the painting. To help with our photographs, we brought in professional photographer, and fellow Licensed Battlefield Guide, Bill Dowling.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Chapters 1-3, Sue Boardman explores the process of creating a cyclorama, the history of the Gettysburg cycloramas, and some of the more unusual facets of the cyclorama.&nbsp; Chapter 4 will focus on one of our most interesting discoveries: &nbsp;the fact that the Boston cyclorama was modified in 1889.&nbsp; The remaining chapters contain my analysis of the painting and the various historic keys.&nbsp; My co-authors were consulted to help confirm some of the narrative, especially where judgment calls were required.&nbsp; As the reader, keep in mind that we were analyzing a work of art and some of our determinations may be subjective and open to interpretation.&nbsp; In areas where there were several possible interpretations, we tried to give multiple options. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, to add to the confusion, there were almost no primary sources to help us interpret what the artist was thinking.&nbsp; To date, we have not discovered Mr. Philippoteaux's diary; if one existed, it would be a gold mine.&nbsp; Much of the existing information comes from newspapers and other sources that are not always reliable.&nbsp; Many descriptions of the painting give conflicting reports.&nbsp; Some of the other important sources, the souvenir programs, were changed in different cities to market the painting to the local audience. This book attempts to answer questions about the painting using the best sources available.&nbsp; New information may come to light, and many of the mysteries might never be fully answered.&nbsp; It is the goal of this book to spark interest and provide more understanding of the amazing work of art that is <i>The Battle of Gettysburg</i> Cyclorama.<br> <br> [1] Dean S.

While most parishioners participate in music making at some level (such as singing hymns or common responses), fewer people might understand the specific genres that comprise the music of an Episcopal worship service or the liturgical meaning behind each selection. This book provides a more in-depth understanding of this rich and complex tradition, discussing the history and evolution of music within the Episcopal Church, including its Anglican roots. Additional topics--such as psalm singing, anthems, major works, organs, and other Anglican traditions (such as Lessons and Carols)--are also addressed.</p><p>&nbsp;<br> [<i>Welcome to Church Music &amp; The Hymnal 1982</i>] is clear, concise, and worth viewing as a resource that can be used to educate those not in our profession... Three chapters deal directly with <i>The Hymnal 1982</i>. Here, Hoch does his best work, effectively showing the deliberate nature of the hymnal and its intentional parallelism with the BCP. His work is especially noteworthy given the fact that, more times than not, many seek to lament its notable shortcomings rather than champion its sizable successes. The author uncorks hymn semantics and unveils such mysteries as tune names and meter, doing so in clear, precise language... [Hoch] recognizes that "the choir is perhaps the most time-consuming ministry in the church" and holds it up as both musical leadership for the congregation as well as the purveyor of a special and noble art... This book could easily form the basis of a substantive parochial education program on the role of church music in the Episcopal Church. It is written with the novice in mind and any technical terminology is quickly and deftly translated... [It] has value and ample rewards for those "not of the cloth." <i>Welcome to Church Music &amp; The Hymnal 1982</i> could well be a useful tool in your educational arsenal.

What are you? What do you want from life? One of the world&#39;s great philosophical teachers, Krishnamurti, offers his inspiring wisdom on many of life&#39;s hurdles from relationships and love, to anxiety and loneliness. He answers such questions as `What is the significance of life?&#39; and &#39;How do I live life to the full?&#39; to reveal the best way of being true to yourself. Read by millions from all walks of life, Krishnamurti shows us there is no path, no higher authority, no guru to follow, and that ultimately it is our own responsibility as to how we live our lives.</p><p>Krishnamurti was born in 1895 in India. He is regarded globally as one of the greatest thinkers and religious teachers in recent times. He explained with great precision the subtle workings of the human mind, and pointed to the need for bringing to our daily life a deeply meditative and spiritual quality. He did not expound any philosophy or religion, but rather talked of the things that concern all of us in our everyday lives, of the problems of living in modern society.

In <em>Crossroads of Freedom</em>, America's most eminent Civil War historian, James M. McPherson, paints a masterful account of this pivotal battle, the events that led up to it, and its aftermath.<br><br>As McPherson shows, by September 1862 the survival of the United States was in doubt. The Union had suffered a string of defeats, and Robert E. Lee's army was in Maryland, poised to threaten Washington. The British government was openly talking of recognizing the Confederacy and brokering a peace between North and South. Northern armies and voters were demoralized. And Lincoln had shelved his proposed edict of emancipation months before, waiting for a victory that had not come that some thought would never come. <br><br>Both Confederate and Union troops knew the war was at a crossroads, that they were marching toward a decisive battle. It came along the ridges and in the woods and cornfields between Antietam Creek and the Potomac River. Valor, misjudgment, and astonishing coincidence all played a role in the outcome. McPherson vividly describes a day of savage fighting in locales that became forever famous The Cornfield, the Dunkard Church, the West Woods, and Bloody Lane. Lee's battered army escaped to fight another day, but Antietam was a critical victory for the Union. It restored morale in the North and kept Lincoln's party in control of Congress. It crushed Confederate hopes of British intervention. And it freed Lincoln to deliver the Emancipation Proclamation, which instantly changed the character of the war. <br><br>McPherson brilliantly weaves these strands of diplomatic, political, and military history into a compact, swift moving narrative that shows why America's bloodiest day is, indeed, a turning point in our history.<br></p><p>The bloodiest day in United States history was September 17, 1862, when, during the Civil War battle at Antietam, close to 6,500 soldiers were killed or mortally wounded and another 15,000 were seriously wounded. Moreover, James M. McPherson states in his concise chronicle of the event <i>Crossroads of Freedom</i>, it may well have been the pivotal moment of the war and possibly of the young republic itself. The South, after a series of setbacks in the spring of 1862, had reversed the war's momentum during the summer, and was on not only on the "brink of military victory" but about to achieve diplomatic recognition by European nations, most notably England and France. Though the bulk of his book concerns itself with the details--and incredible carnage--of the battle itself, McPherson raises it above typical military histories by placing it in its socio-political context: The victory prodded Abraham Lincoln to announce his "preliminary" Emancipation Proclamation, freeing slaves. England and France deferred their economic alliance with the battered secessionists. Most importantly, it kept Lincoln's party, the Republicans, in control of Congress. McPherson's account is accessible, elegant, and economical. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i><br><strong>James M. McPherson</strong> is the George Henry Davis '86 Professor of History at Princeton University. America's leading historian of the Civil War, he won the Pulitzer Prize for <em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em>, which was a <em>New York Times</em> best seller, and he won the Lincoln Prize for <em>For Cause and Comrades</em>.<br></p><h2>Happiness and the Christian Moral Life: An Introduction to Christian Ethics</h2><p>Happiness and the Christian Moral Life introduces students to Christian ethics through the lens of happiness. The book suggests that the heart of ethics is not rules and obligations but our deep desire for happiness and fulfillment. We achieve that happiness when we become people who love the good and seek it in everything we do. <br><br>The third edition of this reader-friendly text has been revised and updated throughout. It introduces Christian ethics with sensitivity towards readers who may not be Christian themselves. After an overview of basic concepts and key thinkers such as Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, subsequent chapters explore the importance of narrative in Christian ethics, the place of friendship and community in Christian moral life, the role of virtues in our quest for fulfillment, a Christian understanding of the person, a Christian theology of freedom, and false steps on the path to happiness. Final chapters discuss the role of conscience and prudence, love, and justice.<br><br>The third edition has been re-structured to better meet teaching needs by moving the discussion of narrative earlier in the book. This edition features fresh, global examples; revised introductions to key thinkers; discussions of tough, contemporary topics such as hook-up culture; careful consideration of the words of Pope Francis on themes ranging from consumerism and freedom to love and the environment; and more.</p><p>Paul J. Wadell is professor of theology and religious studies at St. Norbert College. He specializes in Christian ethics and has taught in this field for more than twenty years.Wadell&#x2019;s new edition of Happiness and the Christian Moral Life: An Introduction to Christian Ethics, is a fresh, enticing, and engaging entr�e into Christian Moral Theology that will quickly 'Friend' and win a 'Like' from undergraduates. From Wadell&#x2019;s pen flows a rich fundamental moral theology that is a formative guide for virtuous Christian living. Once again Wadell demonstrates his skill as a masterful teacher and scholar by including important additions, clarifications, and explanations to the chapters of his original, dynamic, and compelling work. (Dawn M. Nothwehr O.S.F., Catholic Theological Union)<br><br>Reading Paul Wadell on the Christian moral life is like sharing a conversation with a wise and faithful friend. Through his graceful engagement of Augustine, Aquinas, and a host of contemporary Christian thinkers, Wadell reminds us that the quest for true happiness requires virtue, friendship, and an awareness of the stories that bind us. This third edition of an already superb book is theologically rich and deeply human. One cannot read Wadell without about being challenged and inspired.<br> (Darin H. Davis, director, Institute for Faith and Learning, Baylor University)<br><br>In this new edition, Paul Wadell has substantially improved what was already a very fine book. While maintaining an engaging and down to earth style throughout, Wadell ably leads readers toward a sophisticated Christian understanding of the relationship among freedom, happiness, and the cultivation of virtue. Theologically rich, yet accessible and clear, Happiness and the Christian Moral Life would serve very well as a foundational text for an introductory undergraduate course in Christian ethics. (Christopher P. Vogt, St. John&#x2019;s University)<br><br>Happiness and the Christian Moral Life provides an extensive and wonderfully engaging introduction to deep thinking about the moral life. I have never read an introduction to Christian ethics which more warmly invites readers into the profoundly interconnected consideration of virtue, friendship, narrative, and happiness, or which more richly deserves a new edition. The welcoming tone and high precision with which we are invited by Paul Wadell to think about the Christian moral life as "learning to be happy" is effective in its approach and transformative in the challenging questions it poses to the reader. This edition takes Wadell's masterful ability to draw one into bone-deep reconsiderations of ethics through new connections between virtue and narrative, temporal happiness and eschatological fulfillment, communities of friendship and moral development, infused virtues and the natural law, and vocation and daily life. Sitting at the feet of this gentle, confessional, contemplative, and humorous voice for ten chapters is an aesthetic experience, yet always insightfully tied to the daily practice of Christian discipleship.<br> (Carter Aikin, Blackburn College)<br><br>This is a marvelous book, helpful for scholars, students, and pastoral workers alike. Wadell brings the richness of the Catholic moral tradition to bear on the contemporary scene with clarity, enthusiasm and grace. Happiness and the Christian Moral Life is not merely a work of information, but an invitation to formation, an opportunity to think and feel deeply about the moral life as the locus of deepening our friendship with God.<br> (Lisa Fullam, Jesuit School of Theology, Santa Clara University)<br><br>Those of us who teach Christian Ethics are always looking for a new textbook that will cover the basics of our field. But if a student came to my office looking for a guide for the journey to the virtuous life, I would put a copy of Happiness and the Christian Moral Life: An Introduction to Christian Ethics in her hand, and I would know I had done her a real service. This is a book for the heart and mind yearning for the happiness that comes from becoming fully human. (Patrick T. McCormick, Gonzaga University, Spokane)<br><br>Paul Wadell&#x2019;s Happiness and the Christian Moral Life is the clearest and most accessible introduction to Christian Virtue Ethics I know of. Wadell makes Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas come to life in a beautiful, compelling way that can capture the imagination of even the most resistant undergraduate reader. (Joel James Shuman, King's College)<br><br>Perhaps the greatest value of this third edition of Paul Wadell&#x2019;s provocative, inviting, and elegantly written book, Happiness and the Christian Moral Life, is the insight it offers into the very nature of God as the source and satisfaction of our longing for love, peace, and an enduring happiness. (Scott Geis, Christian Brothers University)<br><br>In the age of Pope Francis, Wadell provides an ideal introduction to Christian ethics for undergraduate students. This book situates ethical dilemmas within the larger context of the search for meaning and happiness and would provide a great anchor for an undergraduate course. Wadell is obviously a seasoned instructor who anticipates the questions young adults bring to the study of ethics. He meets students where they are and challenges them to embrace the quest for a virtuous life. Like Pope Francis, he speaks of the beauty of Christian life and insists that joy is essential to Christian discipleship.

A native of Detroit, Jess is a proud alumni of the Chicago Green Mill Slam teams and Cave Canem. His book, African American Pride, was published by Citadel Press in 2003.Jess' debut, an addictive amalgamation of approaches reminiscent, in its way, of Dos Passos' 1919, tells the story of Huddie William Ledbetter and his passage to becoming the blues legend, Leadbelly. Told through many voices, from his devoted wife Martha to folklorist John Lomax and his quest to "stake his claim on the breath of each Black / willing to open his mouth and spit out / southern legend's soiled roots," the collection proceeds by call and response, each negation an affirmation of something else, like trading "dry psalms...for cool cigar smoke." In the telling of one life, a society is exposed-racist, well-meaning, violent, forgiving. And yet while the classic binaries-black and white, man and woman, powerful and powerless-play their part, the collection's strength lies in its contradictory forms; from biography to lyric to hard-driving prose poem, boast to song, all are soaked in the rhythm and dialect of Southern blues and the demands of honoring one's talent. Readers will notice these poems teach us how to read them, but more so, these poems demand performance, recalling that space beyond the page: the stage. Jess has crafted this collection in the logic of its subject, that is, rhythm and performance, proving that a good poem-slam or not-neither needs nor abandons its poet once on the page.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is all I had!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not true,&#x201d; Owen said, turning to his former archenemy. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t you, Your Majesty. You&#x2019;re not meant to be evil. Someone&#x2019;s rewritten your story, just as you tried to do for Bethany.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not?&#x201d; the former king said. &#x201c;Then what was I meant to be?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A father,&#x201d; Owen said quietly, then wrote something on his paper.<br> <br>The former King of All Stories turns back into his real self.<br> <br>Instantly a bright light filled the room, then spread out over the entire Kingdom of Stories, blinding anyone who happened to be looking at the castle at that moment.

Spike, Owen&#x2019;s fictional self&#x2019;s former cat, glanced up at Owen from his desk with a look that said, Really?<br> <br>&#x201c;Too much?&#x201d; Owen asked his fictional cat.<br> <br>Spike just blinked his eyes slowly, leaving his paw on Owen&#x2019;s hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have,&#x201d; Charm said, looking at Owen with affection.<br> <br>Spike dug his claws into Owen&#x2019;s hand, and Owen sighed. &#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Charm said, stepping away from the other two. &#x201c;No one else thinks this is a trap? I&#x2019;m the only one?&#x201d;<br> <br>Spike took his paw off of Owen&#x2019;s hand and began to purr contentedly as he closed his eyes to nap again.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, I&#x2019;m the one who&#x2019;s writing this,&#x201d; Owen said. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s not exactly easy. Maybe at least hold your judgment until it&#x2019;s done?&#x201d;<br> <br>Spike briefly opened his eyes, then closed them again, completely unmoved.<br> <br>Owen absently scratched his cat&#x2019;s stomach, reading over what he had written. Ugh. Why was it all so bad? Did every writer have this problem? Everything just seemed so . . . obvious. Make the villain Bethany&#x2019;s dad? It&#x2019;d been done a thousand times.<br> <br>He began to idly tap the keys without pressing them while he stared off into space. When he glanced back at the computer, though, there were new words. Apparently he&#x2019;d been typing without realizing it?<br> <br>&#x201c;Owen,&#x201d; said a man who appeared out of nowhere, with no features or details anywhere on his body. The mannequin-looking man had his back to the Owen in the story as he spoke to the real Owen. &#x201c;Stop this at once. You&#x2019;re manipulating fictional characters&#x2019; lives. Do you have any idea what you&#x2019;re doing here?&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen&#x2019;s eyes widened as he read the lines, while at his side, Spike began to growl, low and menacing. Owen hadn&#x2019;t just written those words . . . had he?<br> <br>And then more text appeared on the screen, without Owen even moving his hands.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do not write again,&#x201d; Nobody said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to have to tell you this twice.&#x201d; And with that, he disappeared.<br> <br>A chill went through Owen, and he quickly reread the last few lines. What had just happened? Was that really Nobody? And if so, was Owen actually messing with real fictional people&#x2019;s lives? Had he just created another fictional Owen?<br> <br>He quickly highlighted the entire story, ready to hit the delete button, then froze. What if he had created new people, and was now going to delete them? Would that take them out of existence somehow? His finger hovered over the button as he looked to Spike for an answer. But now that Nobody was gone, the cat seemed to have returned to his nap, not paying any attention.<br> <br>Should he delete the story, or was that worse? If only there was someone he could ask&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;OWEN!&#x201d; shouted someone from mere inches away.<br> <br>Owen screamed and tumbled out of his chair, while Spike tore away across the room, hiding under the bed. His heart racing, Owen turned to find Bethany&#x2019;s head sticking out of a piece of paper on his desk, and he gave her the dirtiest look he could.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that! You scared me half to death!&#x201d; She&#x2019;d given him a page from a book she kept hidden under her bed. In case of emergencies (fictional characters escaping their books, libraries burning down, that kind of thing) she could jump in one page, move to the next part of the story, then pop out of his. But it was not meant for terrifying him!<br> <br>&#x201c;Good, you should be scared!&#x201d; she said, breathing heavily. &#x201c;Because that guy is back on the street again, the one who keeps watching my house!&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen groaned loudly. &#x201c;Seriously? This again?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, is my being stalked by a crazy person boring to you?&#x201d; Bethany asked, giving him a sarcastic look. &#x201c;Get over here and help me spy on him!&#x201d; She moved her head to the side, and one hand popped out of the page.<br> <br>Owen shook his head. &#x201c;No way. Remember what happened last time I came over to check on this guy?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany rolled her eyes. &#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t there, but only because he must have seen us coming!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And the time before that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That one, I got the car wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And we terrified that poor old lady!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then she shouldn&#x2019;t be acting so suspiciously!&#x201d; Bethany yelled, her hand flying around wildly. &#x201c;Who sits in their car for ten minutes at eleven at night?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She couldn&#x2019;t get it started!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what she wanted us to think,&#x201d; Bethany said, glancing around suspiciously. &#x201c;Hurry up, or he might leave again!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which would mean he&#x2019;s not actually spying on you,&#x201d; Owen said, sighing. &#x201c;Bethany, it&#x2019;s been a while since we jumped into a book&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two months, three weeks, and four days, actually. Now come on&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And I know it&#x2019;s been hard on you. But you&#x2019;re kind of acting . . . different now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany&#x2019;s face froze, and she pulled her hand back into the page. &#x201c;What? What are you talking about? Don&#x2019;t you get it? This could be Doyle, or Fowen again. Maybe Fowen got out of the book where I left him and is back for revenge. Or maybe Doyle remembered everything that happened and wants to figure out how I jump into books. If Kiel were here instead of running off to find out who he is without magic, he could just cast a spell or something to find out who this guy is. But without him, we&#x2019;re going to need a good plan.&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen groaned again. &#x201c;No more mysteries. Please? Fowen and Doyle are both still in the fictional world where we left them.

I just think you used to jump into books every night, and now, well, your imagination doesn&#x2019;t have as much to play with, so it&#x2019;s messing with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>She gave him an evil look and started to say something, then stopped, shaking her head. &#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re right. I might have a little bit of cabin fever or something. I&#x2019;ll just go to bed and forget all this. See you tomorrow?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, of course,&#x201d; Owen said, breathing a sigh of relief. He&#x2019;d been worried about saying something for weeks now, but she&#x2019;d been getting more and more frantic to find something exciting in their fairly boring lives, and it was out of control. &#x201c;And Bethany? Only use that page for emergencies. I might not have clothes on or something!&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany rolled her eyes, then waved good-bye and disappeared.<br> <br>Owen slowly got back into his chair, and Spike came trotting out from under the bed, then jumped into his lap. He petted his cat for a moment, then sighed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bethany&#x2019;s going after the guy in the car, isn&#x2019;t she.&#x201d;<br> <br>Spike just purred in response.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Owen said, and set Spike on his bed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go, but this guy better be a murderer or something, or I&#x2019;m going to be really annoyed!&#x201d;</p><h2>Airborne: The Combat Story of Ed Shames of Easy Company</h2><p><p>With an incredible World War II combat record that includes parachuting into Normandy on D-Day and service during Operation <i>Market Garden</i>, at Bastogne and in Germany itself, Ed Shames was involved in some of the most important battles of the war.

But she refuses to let that stop her from living her dreams and begins sneaking out of her family's palazzo under the cover of night to take violin lessons from virtuoso violinist and composer Antonio Vivaldi. However, what begins as secret lessons swiftly evolves into a passionate, consuming love affair.</p><p>Adriana's father is intent on seeing her married to a wealthy, prominent member of Venice's patrician class-and a handsome, charming suitor, whom she knows she could love, only complicates matters-but Vivaldi is a priest, making their relationship forbidden in the eyes of the Church and of society. They both know their affair will end upon Adriana's marriage, but she cannot anticipate the events that will force Vivaldi to choose between her and his music. The repercussions of his choice-and of Adriana's own choices-will haunt both of their lives in ways they never imagined.</p><p>Spanning more than 30 years of Adriana's life, Alyssa Palombo's <i>The Violinist of Venice</i> is a story of passion, music, ambition, and finding the strength to both fall in love and to carry on when it ends.</p></p><p>ALYSSA PALOMBO has published short historical fiction pieces in <i>Black Lantern</i>, <i>Novelletum</i>, and <i>The Great Lakes Review</i>.

Music is Adriana's downfall - she falls deeply and passionately in love with the composer - and ultimately her salvation. The most compelling aspect of the novel is Adriana's love of music and the author's virtuoso descriptions of the Vivaldi's compositions.

She&#x2019;d kept quiet for seven days. Seven days. Now she felt like a pot left too long over the fire. If another old woman gave her a pitying glance, if one more village girl whispered behind her hand . . . by the Most High, she&#x2019;d boil over.<br> <br>She filled a cup for Josiah, her sister&#x2019;s new husband. Who would have believed it? Sirach of Bethany&#x2019;s daughter&#x2014;his younger daughter!&#x2014;choosing her own husband. And what a husband he was. Josiah had many good qualities. He was kind and patient, and everyone knew how he loved Mary. But he was also poor and none too smart. Even his own mother admitted that he was about as useful as a three-legged donkey.<br> <br>She took a deep breath and poured a cup of wine for her father, careful not to spill a drop on his fine linen tunic. When Abba agreed to the betrothal a full year ago, the women of Bethany had gossiped for weeks. Most had concluded that Sirach was eager to be rid of Mary, his grown daughter who spent more time playing with the village children than taking care of her father&#x2019;s household. But they were wrong. Abba loved Mary just as much as he loved Martha and Lazarus.<br> <br>Now, at almost fifteen years, Mary was ready to start her own family with a man she adored. Martha was glad that Abba had allowed Mary her heart&#x2019;s desire. If only he would allow Martha hers.<br> <br>If Mary can choose Josiah, why can&#x2019;t I have a say in my husband? But of course, she knew why.<br> <br>Her eyes strayed to the center of the meadow that stretched between the Mount of Olives and her father&#x2019;s many fields and vineyards. The afternoon sun cast a patina of gold on a pair of musicians&#x2014;an old man playing the flute and a young one strumming the kinnor. Lazarus sat at the kinnor player&#x2019;s feet, watching him with admiration.<br> <br>Martha sighed. Even her little brother got to be closer to Isa than she did.<br> <br>A group of village girls linked arms and began to dance, each eyeing Isa as if he were the last honey cake on the plate. Didn&#x2019;t they have anything else to do but stare and giggle about how handsome he was?<br> <br>Isa didn&#x2019;t even look at them. He never did. He looked into the distance, where the Mount of Olives rose between Bethany and Jerusalem. The love song of Solomon was on his lips, but Martha knew his thoughts were on her. Small comfort, with all the work she had to do.<br> <br>Mary&#x2019;s wedding feast had lasted the full seven days. Abba&#x2019;s excellent wine had flowed as generously as the music, and laughter had filled their courtyard and the meadow that surrounded it. It had been good to celebrate Mary&#x2019;s joy, but with all the rejoicing, Martha had found only a few moments to be alone with Isa. And tomorrow he would leave for the Decapolis. She had to find a way to talk to him today. Who knew when they&#x2019;d see each other again?<br> <br>Mary and her new husband rose from their seats. The men nearest Abba elbowed each other and smiled. Martha averted her eyes from the couple. The sun wasn&#x2019;t even behind the blossoming apricot trees, and they were already going to the marriage tent? Of course, they wanted children, and there was only one way to get them. But did they have to look so eager? People would talk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Leaving us so soon?&#x201d; Simon, their neighbor and one of the most respected men in Bethany, was a handsome man&#x2014;at least that&#x2019;s what the village girls said&#x2014;but his large, wide-set eyes and full lips had always reminded Martha of a fish. He pursed his thick lips and raised his brows. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never known a man to need so much sleep.&#x201d;<br> <br>A chorus of twitters sounded from maidens clustered in the shade of the olive grove. Older women, those with babies at their breasts and sleepy toddlers, exchanged knowing glances.<br> <br>Martha watched as the bridal couple took their leave of her father. She had to admit, marriage agreed with her sister. Mary&#x2019;s softly rounded face glowed, and her eyes, the same deep brown as Martha&#x2019;s, shone with what must be the marital bliss Martha had heard of. The linen dress Martha had made for her&#x2014;the best linen, dyed Mary&#x2019;s favorite shade of pink&#x2014;fit her plump curves perfectly and suited her bronze skin and the deep blush on her cheeks.<br> <br>As Mary moved beside her new husband, her arms jingled with a dozen brass bracelets, her betrothal gift from Josiah. They weren&#x2019;t silver or gold&#x2014;in fact, they were practically worthless&#x2014;but the best Josiah could afford. Mary hadn&#x2019;t removed them since the ketubah had been signed at their betrothal.<br> <br>Josiah shrugged his thin shoulders as if to brush off the laughter. He looked down at his new bride, and a ridiculous smile stretched from his crinkly eyes to his wispy beard. Josiah wasn&#x2019;t much to look at, but when he smiled at Mary like that Martha could see why her sister had pleaded with Abba&#x2014;even though Josiah owned little more than the cloak on his back and a tiny home in the village.<br> <br>No more servants for Mary, no fine linen from Galilee, no meat in her cooking pot&#x2014;not with Josiah as a husband. They&#x2019;d probably live on barley bread and water. Mary didn&#x2019;t seem to care, and, at this moment, Martha could see why. What would it be like to be adored? To have a husband so in love that he couldn&#x2019;t keep his eyes, or his hands, off you?<br> <br>Yes, Abba gave Mary to Josiah, but he would never let Martha marry Isa. It was unthinkable.<br> <br>As Josiah took leave of his new father-in-law, Mary threw her arms around Martha. &#x201c;It was beautiful. Everything was perfect. Thank you, my sister. I will remember my wedding feast forever.&#x201d;<br> <br>Martha&#x2019;s throat tightened. Her only sister: beautiful, exuberant, not afraid to announce her love for all the world to hear, even the gossips of Bethany. Martha had worked for weeks to make Mary&#x2019;s marriage feast&#x2014;what they&#x2019;d dreamed of since they were children&#x2014;perfect. And it had been. But now she felt as though she stood on the edge of the sea, watching Mary sail away while she stood onshore alone. She kissed her sister&#x2019;s hand and blinked back tears.<br> <br>Mary&#x2019;s smile faded, and she glanced toward the musicians. &#x201c;Have you talked to him?&#x201d;<br> <br>Martha shook her head.<br> <br>Mary squeezed her hand. &#x201c;Talk to Abba,&#x201d; she urged. &#x201c;At least ask him . . . perhaps after another cup of wine?&#x201d;<br> <br>Martha tried to smile at Mary&#x2019;s outlandish suggestion&#x2014;at her hope in a hopeless cause. There wasn&#x2019;t enough wine in all of Judea to make Abba let her marry Isa. Josiah at least lived in Bethany and worshipped at the Temple. But the elder daughter of Sirach, the most respected Pharisee in Bethany, marry someone like Isa? Never. &#x201c;Go.&#x201d; She gave Mary a gentle push. &#x201c;Josiah is waiting.&#x201d;<br> <br>Teasing calls from the women followed Mary and Josiah to the marriage tent, tucked discreetly behind the olive trees, while Martha went back to serving the men. Simon leaned close to Abba, but his commanding voice carried far. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope your grandsons have more sense than their father.&#x201d;<br> <br>Martha clenched her teeth. How dare Simon mock Josiah when he was barely out of earshot? At least I kept my unkind thoughts to myself. She tossed the dirty bowls on a growing pile of dishes and hefted the next delicacy for the guests, rounds of soft wheat cakes, drizzled with honey and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.<br> <br>The other men chuckled, but Abba frowned. &#x201c;Josiah is a righteous man, despite his lack of wealth. He will be a good husband to Mary.&#x201d;<br> <br>Abel, a tool merchant and one of Bethany&#x2019;s city judges, snorted and mumbled, &#x201c;If he can keep food on the table.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Simon nodded as if Abba were Moses himself. &#x201c;You are a wise man and a loving father, Sirach.&#x201d; He tipped his cup to take the last of his wine, then clapped it on the table. &#x201c;Where are your kinsman Jesus of Nazareth and his parents? They are not ones to miss a wedding.&#x201d;<br> <br>Abba looked thoughtfully at the cakes. &#x201c;Jesus sent a message that they could not attend. His father is not long in this world.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;May the God of Abraham and Isaac watch over him.&#x201d; Simon leaned toward Abba. &#x201c;I remember talk of Jesus, many years ago. The priests in the Temple said he was a great scholar, although he was little more than a boy. Some even whispered that he was the Messiah.&#x201d; Simon smiled as he said it, as if he were remembering a joke.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pfft. A Galilean is no scholar,&#x201d; Abel scoffed. &#x201c;Jesus is well past twenty and still working for his father, not even studying the law in Jerusalem.&#x201d;<br> <br>Martha set two cakes in front of her father, her temper rising. Yes, Jesus and his parents were Galileans, but they deserved more respect from Abel and Simon. His mother was Mama&#x2019;s cousin and had always been welcomed in Bethany. And Jesus was like a brother to her and Mary and Lazarus. They&#x2019;d all been disappointed when Jesus hadn&#x2019;t come to Mary&#x2019;s wedding feast.<br> <br>Abba stroked his beard, its silver streaks glinting in the sun. &#x201c;There have been many&#x2014;far too many&#x2014;who have claimed to be the Messiah. They&#x2019;ve ended up dead, and many righteous men have died with them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon eyed the cakes as Martha came closer. &#x201c;But surely the Anointed One will come. Someday.&#x201d;<br> <br>Abba frowned. &#x201c;If we keep the law, the Lord will surely send the Deliverer, but we must be vigilant against false prophets. We must doubt, until his power is proven to us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon tilted his head toward his host. &#x201c;As always, you are blessed with wisdom, Sirach.&#x201d; He turned to Abel and whispered, &#x201c;As if the Messiah could come from a poor hovel in Nazareth.&#x201d;<br> <br>Martha bristled, her temper sizzling like water on hot coals. Simon and Abel wouldn&#x2019;t know the Messiah if he sat down at the table with them and announced the coming of the Kingdom. No one was good enough to be their Messiah.<br> <br>Abba motioned for Martha to serve the rest of the honey cakes, as if he hadn&#x2019;t heard their disrespectful talk. &#x201c;Let us enjoy the feast and the last rays of the sun. You know every woman in Bethany wishes they could make cakes as light as the clouds, like my Martha.&#x201d;<br> <br>Martha plopped a cake in front of Simon before banging the wooden tray beside Abel. Abba raised his brows in surprise, a question in his eyes. She pressed her lips together and looked away, ashamed at her display of temper.<br> <br>He who honors his father atones for sins. Was it a sin to think badly of her father&#x2019;s friends? If it was, she&#x2019;d atone tomorrow.<br> <br>Tomorrow, when Mary moved into her new home with her new husband.<br> <br>Tomorrow, when Isa left, and she wouldn&#x2019;t see him until Tabernacles.<br> <br>Abba returned his attention to his guests, but Simon watched her closely. Lately, it seemed he was always watching her.<br> <br>She crossed her arms and looked at the ground. When would they stop their talk long enough to eat and let her clear the empty dishes before them? It wasn&#x2019;t as though she didn&#x2019;t have other things to do.<br> <br>Simon licked the last of the honey from his fingers and stretched his arms over his head with a deep sigh. His rounded stomach strained his fine linen tunic. &#x201c;Your daughter is the best cook in Bethany, Sirach.&#x201d; His words may have been to her father, but his fishlike eyes were on Martha. &#x201c;Tell me again why she isn&#x2019;t married before her younger sister?&#x201d;<br> <br>Martha knew what was coming next. She&#x2019;d heard it enough from the women in the last year. And with good reason. She was almost seventeen years old, long past time to talk of marriage.<br> <br>Abba fished a lamb bone from his plate and nibbled the remaining meat from it. &#x201c;No man in Bethany is worthy of my Martha,&#x201d; he said, his lips shiny with the cumin sauce that every woman in Bethany tried and failed to duplicate.<br> <br>&#x201c;But you will let her marry?&#x201d; Simon smiled.<br> <br>Martha stilled her hands, waiting for her father&#x2019;s reply.<br> <br>Abba chewed thoughtfully. &#x201c;Most women let their hearts rule their heads, but not my Martha. She knows that the way to the Lord is through obedience and purity, just like her mother, blessed be her memory.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Blessed be her memory forever,&#x201d; Simon repeated. &#x201c;An obedient daughter is indeed rare and deserves a righteous husband.&#x201d;<br> <br>Martha&#x2019;s stomach turned. A righteous husband.<br> <br>Abba nodded. &#x201c;She is a daughter I won&#x2019;t easily part with. How could I give away such a treasure except to the most righteous man I can find? A man who can give her everything that I have given her.&#x201d;<br> <br>A treasure. Martha&#x2019;s chest constricted, and despair clogged her throat. Across the meadow, Isa&#x2019;s gaze was turned on her. The lilt of the kinnor joined with his deep voice, his song for her alone. She blinked back tears. Isa could never be the husband her father wanted for her, because he wasn&#x2019;t righteous. He was a pagan. And he could give her nothing, because he had nothing.<br> <br>Still, her heart cried out for Isa even as her head told her that the boy she&#x2019;d loved since she was a child would never be worthy of Abba&#x2019;s treasure.</p><h2>Essential Oils for a Clean and Healthy Home: 200+ Amazing Household Uses for Tea Tree Oil, Peppermint Oil, Lavender Oil, and More</h2><p>As seen on Today.com<br><br> Discover the power of essential oils!<br><br>From tea tree and lavender to lemon and peppermint, essential oils have been praised for their ability to clean and protect surfaces. <i>Essential Oils for a Clean and Healthy Home</i> teaches you how to use all-natural oils around your home, from cleaning kitchen appliances to disinfecting bathrooms to getting rid of pests and smells.

She lives with her family in Los Angeles.Star Trek: Voyager: Atonement 1<p></p> <br>STARSHIP VOYAGER<br> <br>Captain Chakotay had asked Captain Regina Farkas, of the Vesta, and Commander Glenn, of the Galen, to join him as he brought his acting first officer, Lieutenant Harry Kim, and Commander B&#x2019;Elanna Torres into the small circle he intended to utilize in managing the current crisis. Lieutenant Kenth Lasren, his Betazoid ops officer, Counselor Hugh Cambridge, and Admiral Janeway&#x2019;s personal aide, Decan, were also present. Both were already well aware of how complicated their mission had become in the last few hours.<br> <br>Torres and Kim appeared stunned and sickened by their captain&#x2019;s revelations. The shock had already passed for everyone else and been replaced by mingled trepidation and determination.<br> <br>Commander Torres was the first to speak. &#x201c;I just want to make sure I&#x2019;ve got this straight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; Chakotay said.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Kinara are about to put Admiral Janeway on trial for crimes she supposedly committed during Voyager&#x2019;s maiden trek in the Delta Quadrant. Once that trial ends&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Presumably with the admiral&#x2019;s execution,&#x201d; Counselor Cambridge interjected.<br> <br>&#x201c;Almost certainly,&#x201d; Captain Farkas corrected him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Once that trial ends,&#x201d; Torres repeated, refusing to acknowledge or accept their pessimism, &#x201c;the Kinara intend to open negotiations with the Confederacy for passage through their local network of subspace corridors for the purpose of acquiring some unknown resources that lie beyond Confederacy space but can only be readily accessed by utilizing their corridors.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which we cannot allow to happen,&#x201d; Captain Farkas noted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because we now know that whatever the Kinara&#x2019;s objectives might once have been, in the last few months they have come under the influence of at least four of the original eight Neyser essences,&#x201d; Torres continued.<br> <br>&#x201c;Individuals believed to be so dangerous that their own people intentionally disembodied them and kept them incarcerated for thousands of years,&#x201d; Cambridge reminded her.<br> <br>&#x201c;And who have used their first taste of freedom to convince or coerce some of the most powerful Delta Quadrant species already predisposed to mistrust the Federation, including the Turei, the Vaadwaur, the Devore, and the Voth, to ally themselves against us,&#x201d; Kim added.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is our potential alliance with the Confederacy off the table?&#x201d; Torres asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Admiral Janeway indicated prior to her departure that she did not believe the Federation and the Confederacy could ever form an alliance,&#x201d; Farkas replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;And that was without hearing my report on Voyager&#x2019;s joint mission with the Twelfth Lamont, the results of which, in my opinion, would make any such alliance unconscionable,&#x201d; Chakotay noted.<br> <br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter anymore,&#x201d; Torres argued.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; Chakotay said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Vesta isn&#x2019;t in bad shape, but Voyager lost her main deflector in the last battle and is, conservatively, days away from being completely repaired. Galen is no match for the Kinara&#x2019;s firepower. That gives us one starship against the Kinara&#x2019;s ten, including that Voth monstrosity that almost destroyed us. We&#x2019;re going to need help rescuing Admiral Janeway and the Confederacy is our only option right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;After what Inspector Kashyk&#x2014;or whoever he really is&#x2014;said, I&#x2019;m not sure how inclined the Confederacy will be to offer assistance,&#x201d; Farkas suggested.<br> <br>&#x201c;There is no question that the first consul, Lant Dreeg, arranged for the admiral&#x2019;s capture in order to force us to offer the Market Consortium the technology they requested&#x2014;technology with which we cannot responsibly part at the moment&#x2014;in return for aiding us in recovering our admiral,&#x201d; Cambridge asserted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Be that as it may,&#x201d; Chakotay said, &#x201c;General Mattings has indicated that he intends to assist us, and nothing I&#x2019;ve heard has convinced me that Presider Cin entirely approved of her first consul&#x2019;s actions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We need to find out where the Confederacy stands right now,&#x201d; Farkas said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Among other things,&#x201d; Chakotay agreed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Meanwhile, the Doctor has suffered some catastrophic damage?&#x201d; Torres asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Barclay has transferred his program back to the Galen and is working on it as we speak,&#x201d; Chakotay reported. &#x201c;The Doctor made some alarming discoveries about the catomic plague before I had to deactivate him. He asked that we try to get that data back to Seven as soon as possible.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If not sooner,&#x201d; Cambridge insisted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Demeter has yet to report in?&#x201d; Farkas asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Demeter should have returned to Confederacy space more than twelve hours ago. If she&#x2019;s not back soon, someone is going to have to go after her,&#x201d; Chakotay replied.<br> <br>Farkas nodded. After a few moments of tense silence she said, &#x201c;This is a mess, but our first priority is rescuing the admiral.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She has no desire to be rescued, and indeed left explicit orders that we should do nothing to risk the current cease-fire,&#x201d; Decan said, speaking for the first time since the briefing had begun.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s absurd,&#x201d; Torres said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to kill her. We can&#x2019;t just sit here and let them do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We must not allow our fear for her safety to force us to act precipitously,&#x201d; Decan insisted. &#x201c;There is no question that Admiral Janeway intends for us to keep the lines of communication open between ourselves and Presider Cin. She sacrificed herself, in part, to ensure that the Kinara did not succeed in allying themselves with the Confederacy and turning them against us. But she also intends to discover &#x2018;Meegan&#x2019;s&#x2019; true intentions toward this region of space.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s going to be a little hard to do while she&#x2019;s fighting for her life,&#x201d; Cambridge said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not necessarily,&#x201d; Decan said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I realize that Admiral Janeway is accustomed to multitasking, Lieutenant, but that&#x2019;s a tall order,&#x201d; Cambridge observed.<br> <br>&#x201c;In addition to requesting a personal security detachment, the admiral&#x2019;s only other nonnegotiable demand prior to her surrender was that the Kinara transmit her trial in real time to the fleet and the Confederacy,&#x201d; Decan said placidly. &#x201c;I suggest that our first duty is ensuring that all parties assembled here enjoy unrestricted access to the upcoming trial.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How are we supposed to do that?&#x201d; Lieutenant Lasren asked. &#x201c;The trial is set to take place aboard the Manticle. They are the ones who will control any transmissions. They can shut it down whenever they like.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, they can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Torres corrected him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Once they open the transmission,&#x201d; Kim continued for her, &#x201c;we can capture the frequency and send our own control virus through their carrier wave. Our open channel will replace theirs and stay open as long as we want.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or until they shut down their entire communications array and perform a hard reset,&#x201d; Torres noted.<br> <br>Chakotay stared at Decan&#x2019;s implacable face. Although Voyager&#x2019;s captain had known Kathryn longer and much better than her aide, Decan had been by her side constantly throughout her negotiations with the Confederacy. His observation struck Chakotay as significant, and he was frustrated that he could not yet make the connection it seemed Decan already had. &#x201c;Why did Admiral Janeway insist on this?&#x201d; Chakotay finally asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;It is my belief that the admiral intends to resolve this situation long before her trial can conclude,&#x201d; Decan said.<br> <br>For the first time since Kathryn&#x2019;s capture, a faint spark of hope lit Chakotay&#x2019;s eyes as the significance of Kathryn&#x2019;s nonnegotiable demand suddenly became clear to him. That spark faded just as quickly as the many possible flaws in her plan began to take horrific shape in his mind&#x2019;s eye. Setting them aside, he smiled grimly, saying, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how she intends to beat them.&#x201d;<br> <br>MANTICLE<br> <br>Admiral Kathryn Janeway should have spent the last several hours reviewing her memories of Voyager&#x2019;s first encounters with the Turei, the Vaadwaur, the Devore, and the Voth.<br> <br>Instead, she could not stop thinking about a kiss.<br> <br>When Decan had told her of his telepathic sense that Devore Inspector Kashyk was literally of &#x201c;two minds,&#x201d; internally divided between ancient rage and a desire to see Kathryn safe, the final piece of the puzzle she had tried to solve for weeks&#x2014;ever since she had learned of the alliance between the Devore, the Vaadwaur, and the Turei, and the actions of the Voth against her fleet&#x2019;s communications relays&#x2014;had finally locked into place.<br> <br>Lieutenant Barclay had been obsessed for months with locating their rogue hologram, &#x201c;Meegan.&#x201d; Janeway had added this concern to her lengthy to-do list upon assuming command of the Full Circle Fleet, and it had rested in the back of her mind until it was forced out of the shadows by Decan&#x2019;s revelation. The only plausible explanation for the recent alliance between these four familiar, hostile, and xenophobic species was some powerful outside influence, and an ancient species with access to all of Voyager&#x2019;s databases that could possess high-level individuals at will was an incredibly likely candidate.<br> <br>Janeway had asked Lieutenant Lasren to accompany her to the Manticle, and his subtle nod before he departed had confirmed what the kiss with which she had greeted Inspector Kashyk had already told her.<br> <br>She had kissed him once before. It had been a spontaneous gesture, born of the closeness that had developed between them over several days and nights when they had seemed to share a common goal and purpose. But it had also been a test. Hers might not have been the most experienced lips in the galaxy, but they had assured her of Kashyk&#x2019;s genuine response. The heat and desire in that kiss had been unmistakable.<br> <br>His heart, of course, had never been hers.<br> <br>The truth of the second kiss had been more painful than the first. The moment their lips had touched in the Manticle&#x2019;s shuttlebay, Janeway had felt Kashyk&#x2019;s desire once again, but this time there had been urgency, desperation to it. The sensation had vanished too soon as his lips had hardened and rough hands had pushed her away.<br> <br>Decan had been right. Kashyk was still there, but he was no longer controlling his mind or body.<br> <br>Her thoughts unwillingly returned to what little she remembered of her time as a Borg Queen. Some small shred of Kathryn Janeway had existed, secured in a cell within a mind that was no longer hers. From that cell she had witnessed atrocities. She had felt the Queen&#x2019;s ecstasy. She had fought desperately to regain control, but it had been impossible.<br> <br>Despite the fact that Kashyk had been her enemy, she wondered if that was now his reality. If it was, he did not deserve it. No sentient being did.<br> <br>That the entity that now possessed Kashyk clearly wanted her dead was neither surprising nor relevant. Janeway could not hate Kashyk. She couldn&#x2019;t even fear him. All she could do was pity him.<br> <br>The door to her &#x201c;quarters&#x201d; slid open and a Devore security officer flanked by two armed guards entered holding a set of heavy silver manacles. Lieutenants Psilakis and Cheng, her personal security team, rose and moved to stand between her and the Devore officer.<br> <br>&#x201c;You will remain here,&#x201d; he advised them.<br> <br>&#x201c;No. That was not our understanding,&#x201d; Psilakis said firmly.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, Lieutenant,&#x201d; Janeway said, placing a hand on his arm and gently pressing him back. She then lifted her eyes to meet the Devore officer and extended her hands to him, her palms upward.<br> <br>Her life might be over within a matter of hours. But until it was, a number of battles remained that must be won.<br> <br>FIFTH SHUDKA<br> <br>&#x201c;There was no good answer, Presider,&#x201d; Captain Chakotay insisted. &#x201c;We settled for the least bad one, which was often the case during our first journey through this quadrant.&#x201d;<br> <br>Most of Chakotay&#x2019;s interactions with the peoples of the Confederacy had been with Leodts like General Mattings: dark-skinned humanoids with black eyes, flattened noses, and mouths composed of a ring of sharp protruding teeth. Presider Isorla Cin was Djinari. The golden, diamond-shaped scales that covered her scalp did not seem to allow for a variety of facial expressions that might betray subtle reactions to his words. The long, thin tendrils that extended from the base of her neck were more fluid. They tensed and relaxed conspicuously, but Chakotay had yet to assign meaning to their movements.<br> <br>Cin had sat placidly behind an ornate, gilt desk in her receiving room aboard the Shudka and listened patiently while Chakotay had provided some much-needed context to the charges &#x201c;Devore Inspector Kashyk&#x201d; had made against Admiral Janeway and the Federation before the battle that had cost the Confederacy thirty-five of their ships and the Full Circle Fleet their admiral. The captain had not yet advised Cin that he believed Kashyk, and several of the other Kinara leaders, to be possessed by Neyser essences. The truth of Voyager&#x2019;s first contact with the Voth, the Turei, the Vaadwaur, and the Devore Imperium should have been more than enough to convince Cin whose side she should take.<br> <br>The presider had seemed relieved by Chakotay&#x2019;s recounting of Voyager&#x2019;s encounters with the Delta Quadrant powers. She clearly wanted to believe that Admiral Janeway had been on the right side of these conflicts. She had cooled visibly, however, when Chakotay began to recount their introduction to the Devore, rising from her desk and pacing the room fitfully.<br> <br>&#x201c;But you knew the Devore could not countenance the presence of telepaths in their territory,&#x201d; Cin argued. &#x201c;As your crew included telepathic species even before you encountered the Brenari refugees, surely you would have been better served by simply charting a course around their space.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We understood, as the Devore did not, that the telepaths who were part of our crew posed no threat to them,&#x201d; Chakotay insisted. &#x201c;I agree that assisting the Brenari might be construed as crossing the line, but we were not aiding individuals who had come to make war on the Devore. Had their ship not been damaged, they would never have found themselves in Devore space. They were civilians, some of them young children. Their only goal was to get safely out of the Devore&#x2019;s territory as soon as possible. We shared that goal. Voyager possessed technology we believed would allow us to protect the Brenari the same way we were already protecting our telepathic crewmen. It seemed unconscionable to refuse to aid them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cin shook her head. Clearly frustrated, she said, &#x201c;Often when I spoke with Admiral Janeway in the last several weeks, I was struck by your Federation&#x2019;s seeming contradictions.

He knows how to do everything, from jumping rope to leading nature walks. Everyone loves him. . . except for Eugene Esterhause. "Mean Gene" hates everyone who's different. He's a bully, a bad student, and he calls people awful, racist names. But Mr. Lincoln knows that Eugene isn't really bad-he's just repeating things he's heard at home. Can the principal find a way to get through to "Mean Gene" and show him that the differences between people are what make them special?<br><br> With Patricia Polacco's trademark illustrations and gentle text, <b>Mr. Lincoln's Way</b> celebrates the unforgettable school principal who touches the lives of his students and truly empowers them.</p><p>"I was born in Lansing, Michigan in 1944.

Here she tackles both intolerance and bullying. Mr. Lincoln is the "coolest" principal: he is Santa at Christmas, lights the menorah at Chanukah, and wears a dashiki for Kwanza and a burnoose for Ramadan. The author chronicles his attempt to reclaim "Mean Gene," a child who sasses his teachers, picks on other children, and makes ethnic slurs. "`He's not a bad boy, really,' Mr. Lincoln said. `Only troubled.'" However, the distinction is not clarified. When the principal discovers that the boy is fond of birds, he capitalizes on this interest. He involves him in attracting the creatures to the school atrium while at the same time showing him that just as the differences in the birds render them beautiful, so do the differences in people. While the theme is an important and timely one, Polacco has allowed her message to overwhelm both plot and character development. The story emerges as didactic, laden with heavy-handed metaphor, and too simplistic a solution to a deep-rooted problem. The book may be useful to schools in need of a springboard for discussion of the topic and is graced with impressive watercolors, but it is not up to the author's usual literary standards.<p></p><p><i>Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Nothing: Surprising Insights Everywhere from Zero to Oblivion</h2><p><b>Incredible discoveries from the fringes of the universe to the inner workings of our minds&#x2014;all from nothing!</b><br><br> It turns out that almost nothing is as curious&#x2014;or as enlightening&#x2014;as, well, nothing.

Yet nothing could be further from the truth, as Michael W. Harris's history of gospel blues reveals. Tracing the rise of gospel blues as seen through the career of its founding figure, Thomas Andrew Dorsey, Harris tells the story of the most prominent person in the advent of gospel blues.<br> Also known as "Georgia Tom," Dorsey had considerable success in the 1920s as a pianist, composer, and arranger for prominent blues singes including Ma Rainey. In the 1930s he became involved in Chicago's African-American, old-line Protestant churches, where his background in the blues greatly influenced his composing and singing. Following much controversy during the 1930s and the eventual overwhelming response that Dorsey's new form of music received, the gospel blues became a major force in African-American churches and religion. His more than 400 gospel songs and recent Grammy Award indicate that he is still today the most prolific composer/publisher in the movement. Delving into the life of the central figure of gospel blues, Harris illuminates not only the evolution of this popular musical form, but also the thought and social forces that forged the culture in which this music was shaped.<br></p><p>Although gospel music has been a taproot for soul, jazz, and rock-and-roll, it remains a fairly insulated art, with its own venues, audience, and mythology. A good place to start investigating this revelatory music is Michael Harris's <i>The Rise of the Gospel Blues: The Music of Thomas Andrew Dorsey in the Urban Church.</i> Dorsey (1899-1993), the inventor of modern gospel, began playing the piano in small-town Georgia bordellos at the age of 12. As a young man he wrote more than 2,000 blues songs, including such naughty novelties as "Tight Like That." In the mid-1920s, however, Dorsey began producing a string of sacred-and-profane hybrids, many of which became building blocks of the gospel repertoire. Harris has written a smart, scholarly portrait of a musical giant who continued to perform right through the late 1980s--and who made his feature-film debut at age 84, in the delightful <i>Say Amen, Somebody.</i>Most observers believe that gospel music has been sung in African American churches since their organization in the late 1800s. Yet nothing could be further from the truth, as Michael W. Harris's history reveals. Working through the blues and gospel movement. Harris reconstructs the rise of gospel blues within the context of early twentieth century African American cultural history. <p>After a nervous breakdown and a subsequent religious conversion in 1928. Dorsey began to write gospel songs with blues accompaniments. His introduction of these "goals" into Chicago's Afro-Baptist churches during the 1930s stirred clashes between recently arrived southern migrants who felt comforted by the new spirituals and old-line members who dismissed the songs as sacrilegious echoes of the slave past. After years of writing and publishing hudnreds of "songs with a message"-- such as "Take My Hand", "Precious Lord", and "There Will Be Peace in the Valley"-- and training gospel singers such as Mahalia Jackson, Dorsey had earned the title of "father" of gospel blues by the early 1940s. Delving into the life of the most prominent person in the advent of the gospel song movement. Harris illuminates not only the evolution of this popular musical form, but also the thought and social forces that forged the culture in which this music was shaped.</p></p><h2>ISE Business Foundations: A Changing World</h2><p><br>ISBN: 9781260565805 is an International Student Edition of Business Foundations: A Changing World 12th Edition by O.

Now Blackburn offers a tour de force exploration of what he calls "the most exciting and engaging issue in the whole of philosophy"--the age-old war over truth. <br><br>The front lines of this war are well defined. On one side are those who believe in plain, unvarnished facts, rock-solid truths that can be found through reason and objectivity--that science leads to truth, for instance. Their opponents mock this idea. They see the dark forces of language, culture, power, gender, class, ideology and desire--all subverting our perceptions of the world, and clouding our judgement with false notions of absolute truth. Beginning with an early skirmish in the war--when Socrates confronted the sophists in ancient Athens--Blackburn offers a penetrating look at the longstanding battle these two groups have waged, examining the philosophical battles fought by Plato, Protagoras, William James, David Hume, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Richard Rorty, and many others, with a particularly fascinating look at Nietzsche. Among the questions Blackburn considers are: is science mere opinion, can historians understand another historical period, and indeed can one culture ever truly understand another. <br><br>Blackburn concludes that both sides have merit, and that neither has exclusive ownership of truth. What is important is that, whichever side we embrace, we should know where we stand and what is to be said for our opponents.<br></p><p><br><strong>Simon Blackburn</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge. He was Edna J. Doury Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina, and from 1969 to 1990 was a Fellow and Tutor at Pembroke College, Oxford. He is the author of <em>The Oxford Dictionary of</em> <em>Philosophy</em> and the best-selling <em>Think</em> and <em>Being Good</em>, among other books.<br><br>"Blackburn's lively new book 'Truth: A Guide' will challenge and surprise you.... The great achievement of 'Truth' is to encapsulate the major lines of argument on this intractable question within the covers of a book you can read in a day or two. His chapter on Nietzsche, the fountainhead of modern philosophy and the patron saint of relativism, is worth the price of admission by itself."--Andrew O'Hehir, <em>Salon.com</em><p></p><br>"Admirably sketching the battle lines currently staked out over the idea of objective truth, [Blackburn] makes his subject lively and accessible even as he parts some of its deepest waters.... Blackburn considers truth 'the most exciting and engaging issue in the whole of philosophy,' and, with wit and erudition, he succeeds in proving that point."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Fluid, highly literate, and deeply informed.... Highly recommended for academic philosophy and literature collections. --<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Gently leads the reader on a guided tour of one simple question--whether there is a universally applicable set of data that can be called capital-T 'Truth'--and its infinite complications."--<em>Seattle Times</em><p></p><br>"If you're annoyed, even incensed, at the relativism and ironic nihilism of the youth (or their free-thinking professors), and you're looking for a vicarious voice to denounce the abject postmodern menace and stand up for Western rationalism, this could be the book for you."--Barry Allen, <em>The Globe</em> <em>and Mail</em><p></p><br>"The pleasure of reading this beautifully written and crafted book is almost sensual, so complete does each sentence seem in its witty unfolding. Blackburn takes up the knottiest philosophical issues--truth, justice, belief, evidence, interpretation--and without dissolving the knots he carefully undoes them, and then, in some cases, reties them. A wonderful embracing tour through the minefield of philosophical controversy that will inform the novice and delight the afficionado."--Stanley Fish<p></p><br>"Between the Scylla of relativism and the Charybdis of absolutism, Simon Blackburn does not merely navigate, but pleasure-sails, visiting and appreciating each. Whether you are appalled by postmodernism, incensed by smug scientism, or simply 'perplexed,' you'll find Blackburn's 'guide' edifying. Learn here what truth is, why it is so elusive, and what hope there is for human knowledge."--Louise Antony, Professor of Philosophy, The Ohio State University<p></p><br></p><h2>Empire&#39;s Workshop: Latin America, the United States, and the Rise of the New Imperialism</h2><p>An eye-opening examination of Latin America's role as proving ground for U.S. imperial strategies and tactics<br><br>In recent years, one book after another has sought to take the measure of the Bush administration's aggressive foreign policy. In their search for precedents, they invoke the Roman and British empires as well as postwar reconstructions of Germany and Japan. Yet they consistently ignore the one place where the United States had its most formative imperial experience: Latin America. <br><br>A brilliant excavation of a long-obscured history, <i>Empire's Workshop</i> is the first book to show how Latin America has functioned as a laboratory for American extraterritorial rule. Historian Greg Grandin follows the United States' imperial operations, from Thomas Jefferson's aspirations for an "empire of liberty" in Cuba and Spanish Florida, to Ronald Reagan's support for brutally oppressive but U.S.-friendly regimes in Central America. He traces the origins of Bush's policies to Latin America, where many of the administration's leading lights--John Negroponte, Elliott Abrams, Otto Reich--first embraced the deployment of military power to advance free-market economics and first enlisted the evangelical movement in support of their ventures.<br><br>With much of Latin America now in open rebellion against U.S. domination, Grandin concludes with a vital question: If Washington has failed to bring prosperity and democracy to Latin America--its own backyard "workshop"--what are the chances it will do so for the world?<br><br></p><p><p>Greg Grandin is the author of <i>Fordlandia</i>, <i>Empire's Workshop</i>, <i>The Last Colonial Massacre</i>, and the award-winning <i>The Blood of Guatemala</i>. An associate professor of Latin American history at New York University, and a Guggenheim fellow, Grandin has served on the United Nations Truth Commission investigating the Guatemalan Civil War and has written for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, <i>The New Statesman</i>, and <i>The New York Times</i>.</p>Introduction<br>The Camel Not in the Koran<br>&nbsp;<br>The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges once remarked that the lack of camels in the Koran proves its Middle Eastern provenance: only a native author, he explained, could have so taken the animal for granted as not to mention it. Perhaps a similar familiarity explains the absence of Latin America in recent discussions about the United States and its empire. Though Latin America has played an indispensable role in the rise of the United States to global power, it elicits little curiosity from its neighbor to the north. "Latin America doesn't matter," Richard Nixon advised a young Donald Rumsfeld, who was casting about for career opportunities. "Long as we've been in it, people don't give one damn about Latin America."1 Likewise today. In their search for historical precedents for our current imperial moment, intellectuals invoke postwar reconstructions of Germany and Japan, ancient Rome and nineteenth-century Britain but consistently ignore the one place where the United States has projected its influence for more than two centuries. "People don't give one shit" about the place, Nixon said.2<br>&nbsp;<br>Were it not for Borges's insight, this studied indifference to Latin America would seem ironic, for the region has long served as a workshop of empire, the place where the United States elaborated tactics of extraterritorial administration and acquired its conception of itself as an empire like no other before it. The Western Hemisphere was to be the staging ground for a new "empire for liberty," a phrase used by Thomas Jefferson specifically in reference to Spanish Florida and Cuba. Unlike European empires, ours was supposed to entail a concert of equal, sovereign democratic American republics, with shared interests and values, led but not dominated by the United States--a conception of empire that remains Washington's guiding vision.<br>&nbsp;<br>The same direction of influence is evident in any number of examples. The United States's engagement with the developing world after World War II, for instance, is often viewed as an extension of its postwar policies in Europe and Japan, yet that view has it exactly backwards. Washington's first attempts, in fact, to restructure another country's economy took place in the developing world--in Mexico in the years after the American Civil War and in Cuba following the Spanish-American War. "We should do for Europe on a large scale," remarked the U.S. ambassador to England in 1914, "essentially what we did for Cuba on a small scale and thereby usher in a new era of human history." Likewise, most discussions of George W. Bush's foreign policy focus on the supposed innovation of a small group of neoconservative intellectuals in asserting the right to unilateral preemptive military action both to defend national security and to advance American ideals. But neither the neocons' dire view of a crisis-ridden world that justifies the use of unilateral and brutal American military power nor their utopian vision of the same world made whole and happy by that power is new. Both have been fully in operation in Washington's approach to Latin America for over a century. The history of the United States in Latin America is cluttered with "preemptive" interventions that even the most stalwart champions of U.S. hegemony have trouble defending.<br>&nbsp;<br>From the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth century, the U.S. military sharpened its fighting skills and developed its modern-day organizational structure largely in constant conflict with Latin America--in its drive west when it occupied Mexico in the mid-nineteenth century and took more than half of that country's national territory. And in its push south: by 1930, Washington had sent gunboats into Latin American ports over six thousand times, invaded Cuba, Mexico (again), Guatemala, and Honduras, fought protracted guerrilla wars in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Haiti, annexed Puerto Rico, and taken a piece of Colombia to create both the Panamanian nation and the Panama Canal. For their part, American corporations and financial houses came to dominate the economies of Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America, as well as large parts of South America, apprenticing themselves in overseas expansion before they headed elsewhere, to Asia, Africa, and Europe.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet Latin America did more than serve as a staging ground for the United States's early push toward empire. The region provided a school where foreign policy officials and intellectuals could learn to apply what political scientists like to call "soft power"--that is, the spread of America's authority through nonmilitary means, through commerce, cultural exchange, and multilateral cooperation.3<br>&nbsp;<br>At first, the United States proved a reluctant student. It took decades of mounting Latin American anti-imperialist resistance, including armed resistance, to force Washington to abandon its militarism. But abandon it it finally did, at least for a short time. In the early 1930s, Franklin D. Roosevelt promised that henceforth the United States would be a "good neighbor," that it would recognize the absolute sovereignty of individual nations, renounce its right to engage in unilateral interventions, and make concessions to economic nationalists. Rather than weaken U.S. influence in the Western Hemisphere, this newfound moderation in fact institutionalized Washington's authority, drawing Latin American republics tighter into its political, economic, and cultural orbit through a series of multilateral treaties and regional organizations. The Good Neighbor policy was the model for the European and Asian alliance system, providing a blueprint for America's "empire by invitation," as one historian famously described Washington's rise to unprecedented heights of world power.4<br>&nbsp;<br>But even as Washington was working out the contours of its kinder, gentler empire in postwar Western Europe and Japan, back in the birthplace of American soft power it was rearming. Latin America once again became a school where the United States studied how to execute imperial violence through proxies. After World War II, in the name of containing Communism, the United States, mostly through the actions of local allies, executed or encouraged coups in, among other places, Guatemala, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina and patronized a brutal mercenary war in Nicaragua. Latin America became a laboratory for counterinsurgency, as military officials and covert operators applied insights learned in the region to Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. By the end of the Cold War, Latin American security forces trained, funded, equipped, and incited by Washington had executed a reign of bloody terror--hundreds of thousands killed, an equal number tortured, millions driven into exile--from which the region has yet to fully recover.<br>&nbsp;<br>This reign of terror has had consequences more far-reaching than the damage done to Latin America itself, for it was this rehabilitation of hard power that directly influenced America's latest episode of imperial overreach in the wake of 9/11.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is often noted in passing that a number of the current administration's officials, advisers, and hangers-on are veterans of Ronald Reagan's Central American policy in the 1980s, which included the patronage of anti-Communist governments in El Salvador and Guatemala and anti-Communist insurgents in Nicaragua. The list includes Elliott Abrams, Bush's current deputy national security adviser in charge of promoting democracy throughout the world; John Negroponte, former U.N. ambassador, envoy to Iraq, and now intelligence czar; Otto Reich, secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere during Bush's first term; and Robert Kagan, an ardent advocate of U.S. global hegemony. John Poindexter, convicted of lying to Congress, conspiracy, and destroying evidence in the Iran-Contra scandal during his tenure as Reagan's national security adviser, was appointed by Rumsfeld to oversee the Pentagon's stillborn Total Information Awareness program. John Bolton, ambassador to the United Nations and an arch-unilateralist, served as Reagan's point man in the Justice Department to stonewall investigations into Iran-Contra.5<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet the links between the current Bush administration's revolution in foreign policy and Reagan's hard line in Central America are even more profound than the simple recycling of personnel. It was Central America, and Latin America more broadly, where an insurgent New Right first coalesced, as conservative activists used the region to respond to the crisis of the 1970s, a crisis provoked not only by America's defeat in Vietnam but by a deep economic recession and a culture of skeptical antimilitarism and political dissent that spread in the war's wake. Indeed, Reagan's Central American wars can best be understood as a dress rehearsal for what is going on now in the Middle East. It was in these wars where the coalition made up of neoconservatives, Christian evangelicals, free marketers, and nationalists that today stands behind George W. Bush's expansive foreign policy first came together. There they had near free rein to bring the full power of the United States against a much weaker enemy in order to exorcise the ghost of Vietnam--and, in so doing, begin the transformation of America's foreign policy and domestic culture.<br>&nbsp;<br>A critical element of that transformation entailed shifting the rationale of American diplomacy away from containment to rollback, from one primarily justified in terms of national defense to one charged with advancing what Bush likes to call a "global democratic revolution." The domestic fight over how to respond to revolutionary nationalism in Central America allowed conservative ideologues to remoralize both American diplomacy and capitalism, to counteract the cynicism that had seeped into both popular culture and the political establishment regarding the deployment of U.S. power in the world. Thus they pushed the Republican Party away from its foreign policy pragmatism to the idealism that now defines the "war on terror" as a world crusade of free-market nation building.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the same time, the conflicts in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala allowed New Right militarists to find ways to bypass the restrictions enacted by Congress and the courts in the wake of Vietnam that limited the executive branch's ability to fight wars, conduct covert operations, and carry out domestic surveillance of political activists. The Reagan White House perfected new techniques to manipulate the media, Congress, and public opinion while at the same time reempowering domestic law enforcement agencies to monitor and harass political dissidents. These techniques, as we shall see, prefigured initiatives now found in the PR campaign to build support for the war in Iraq and in the Patriot Act, reinvigorating the national security state in ways that resonate to this day. The Central American wars also provided the New Christian Right its first extensive experience in foreign affairs, as the White House mobilized evangelical activists in order to neutralize domestic opponents of a belligerent foreign policy. It was here where New Right Christian theologians first joined with secular nationalists to elaborate an ethical justification for a rejuvenated militarism.<br>&nbsp;<br>In other words, it was in Central America where the Republican Party first combined the three elements that give today's imperialism its moral force: punitive idealism, free-market absolutism, and right-wing Christian mobilization. The first justified a belligerent diplomacy not just for the sake of national security but to advance "freedom." The second sanctified property rights and the unencumbered free market as the moral core of the freedom it was America's duty to export. The third backed up these ideals with social power, as the Republican Party learned how to channel the passions of its evangelical base into the international arena.<br>&nbsp;<br>To focus, therefore, exclusively on neoconservative intellectuals, as much of the commentary attempting to identify the origins of the new imperialism does, deflects attention away from the long history of American expansion. The intellectual architects of the Bush Doctrine are but part of a larger resurgence of nationalist militarism, serving as the ideologues of an American revanchism fired by a lethal combination of humiliation in Vietnam and vindication in the Cold War, of which Central America was the tragic endgame.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>After an opening chapter that makes the case for Latin America's role in the formation of the U.S. empire, the rest of this book explores the importance of the region to the consolidation of what could be called a new, revolutionary imperialism. Taken each on their own, the ideas, tactics, politics, and economics that have driven Bush's global policy are not original. An interventionist military posture, belief that America has a special role to play in world history, cynical realpolitik, vengeful nationalism, and free-market capitalism have all driven U.S. diplomacy in one form or another for nearly two centuries. But what is new is how potent these elements have become and how tightly they are bound to the ambitions of America's domestic ruling conservative coalition--a coalition that despite its power and influence paints itself as persecuted, at odds not just with much of the world but with modern life itself.6 The book goes on to explore the intellectual reorientation of American diplomacy in the wake of Vietnam and the increasing willingness of militarists to champion human rights, nation building, and democratic reform. The third chapter considers how the rehabilitation of unconventional warfare doctrine in El Salvador and Nicaragua by militarists in and around the Reagan White House laid the groundwork for today's offensive military posture. Here, the human costs of this resurgence of militarism will be addressed. In the many tributes that followed Reagan's death, pundits enjoyed repeating Margaret Thatcher's comment that Reagan won the Cold War "without firing a shot." The crescendo of carnage that overwhelmed Central America in the 1980s not only gives the lie to such a legacy but highlights the inescapable violence of empire. The fourth chapter turns to the imperial home front, examining how the Reagan administration first confronted and then began to solve the domestic crisis of authority generated by Vietnam and Watergate. It also argues that Reagan's Central American policy served as a crucible that forged the coalition that today stands behind George W. Bush. Chapter 5 is concerned with the economics of empire, how the financial contraction of the 1970s provided an opportunity for the avatars of free-market orthodoxy--the true core of the Bush Doctrine--to join with other constituencies of the ascendant New Right, inaugurating first in Chile and then throughout Latin America a new, brutally competitive global economy.<br>&nbsp;<br>The last chapter tallies the score of the new imperialism in Latin America. Celebrated by Bill Clinton, and now Bush, as a model of what the United States hopes to accomplish in the rest of the world, Latin America continues to be gripped by unrelenting poverty and periodic political instability, as the ...</p><h2>The Legacy of Isaiah Berlin</h2><p>The papers given at the conference and collected in this volume concentrate on three aspects of Berlin&#39;s concept of pluralism. Aileen Kelly, Mark Lilla, and Steven Lukes trace the development and consequences of his distinction between &#34;hedgehogs,&#34; thinkers who have a single, unified theory of human action and history, and &#34;foxes,&#34; who believe in multiplicity and resist the impulse to subject humanity to a universal vision. Ronald Dworkin, Bernard Williams, Thomas Nagel, and Charles Taylor examine how liberalism can be sustained in the face of Berlin&#39;s insight that equally legitimate values, such as liberty and equality, may come into irreconcilable conflict. Avishai Margalit, Richard Wollheim, Michael Walzer, and Robert Silvers take up Berlin&#39;s advocacy for the State of Israel and his hopes for it as a place where the often contrary values of liberalism and nationalism might find harmonious resolution.</p><p></p><h2>My Baby&#39;s Journal (Yellow): The story of baby&#39;s first year</h2><p>Every new parent knows how special and precious the first year of baby&#x2019; s life is.<br><br><b>Every new parent knows how special and precious the first year of baby&#x2019; s life is.</b><br> <br>My Baby&#x2019;s Journal is especially designed so you can hold on to every memorable moment&#x2014;first tooth, first smile, first steps, first words&#x2014;and many more.

Clyburn has led an extraordinary life. In Blessed Experiences, Clyburn tells in his own inspirational words how an African American boy from the Jim Crow-era South was able to beat the odds to achieve great success and become, as President Barack Obama describes him, "one of a handful of people who, when they speak, the entire Congress listens."<br>Born in 1940 to a civic-minded beautician and a fundamentalist minister, Clyburn began his ascent to leadership at the age of twelve, when he was elected president of his National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) youth chapter. He broke barriers through peaceful protests and steadfast beliefs in equality and justice. Of his success Clyburn says he was "blessed with nurturing parents, a supportive family, and loyal friends." But, he added, "my life was not just about knocking down doors and lowering barriers. I spent some time marching in the streets and occupying the inside of South Carolina jails." As a civil rights leader at South Carolina State College, as human affairs commissioner under John C. West and three subsequent governors, and as South Carolina's first African American congressman since 1897, Clyburn has established a long and impressive record of public leadership and advocacy for human rights, education, historic preservation, and economic development.<br>Clyburn was elected to Congress in 1992. Serving as copresident of his freshman class, he rose quickly through the ranks and was elected chair of the Congressional Black Caucus in 1999 and House Democratic Caucus vice chair in 2002. Three years later he was unanimously elected chair of the Democratic Caucus. When Democrats regained the House majority in 2006, Clyburn was elected House majority whip. Now as assistant Democratic leader in the 112th Congress, Clyburn, a self-described independent, prides himself on working to overcome barriers and destroy myths without becoming too predictable. "I have worked across party lines to further legislative causes, and on occasion publicly differed with some of my allies in the civil rights community," says Clyburn. "My experiences have not always been pleasant, but I have considered all of them blessings."<br>Blessed Experiences includes a foreword from Emmy Award-winning actress and the congressman's longtime friend Alfre Woodard.</p><p>The memoir of U.S. Congressman James E.

As the fourth chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, serving from 1801 to 1835, he helped move the court from the fringes of power to the epicenter of constitutional government. His great opinions in cases like Marbury v. Madison and McCulloch v. Maryland are still part of the working discourse of constitutional law in America. Drawing on a new and definitive edition of Marshall's papers, R. Kent Newmyer combines engaging narrative with new historiographical insights in a fresh interpretation of John Marshall's life in the law. <p>Newmyer vividly unfolds Marshall's early Virginia years- his Americanization in Fauquier County before the Revolution, his decision to fight for independence as "a principled soldier," and his emergence as a constitutional nationalist in the 1780s. Marshall's experience as a Federalist politician and a leading Virginia lawyer during the 1790s, Newmyer argues, defined his ideas about judicial review and the role of the Supreme Court as a curb on party-based, states'-rights radicalism. </p><p>Perhaps best known for consolidating the authority of the Supreme Court, Marshall is revealed here to have been equally skilled at crafting law that supported the emerging American market economy. He waged a lifelong struggle against champions of states'-rights constitutional theory, a struggle embodied in his personal and ideological rivalry with Thomas Jefferson. </p><p>More than the summation of Marshall's legal and institutional accomplishments, Newmyer's impressive study captures the nuanced texture of the justice's reasoning, the complexity of his mature jurisprudence, and the affinities and tensions between his system of law and the transformative age in which he lived. It substantiates Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.'s view of Marshall as the most representative figure in American law.</p></p><p>R. Kent Newmyer, professor of law and history at the University of Connecticut School of Law, is the author of &#34;Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story&#34; among other books.In this comprehensive scholarly study of the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1801 to 1835, Newmyer (Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story) succeeds at "locat[ing] Marshall and his jurisprudence in the broader historical context." Newmyer, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law, cites three principal sources for Marshall's constitutional thinking: his experience as a Revolutionary soldier, his law career steeped in the common law tradition, and his upbringing among the landowning elite in Virginia. These formative influences, Newmyer contends, created in the fourth chief justice a belief system centered on the primacy of the federal union and respect for property rights. As a judge, Marshall (1755-1835) believed in but did not always practice nonpolitical interpretation of the Constitution. Newmyer profiles a dozen of the justice's foundational opinions for the Supreme Court, demonstrating Marshall's persistent nationalist vision in which a written Constitution trumps divisive state and local interests. At the end of his career, Marshall believed his vision had been swept aside by history; and so it had, as states' rights gained ascendancy in the years leading up to the Civil War. However, his decisions are still cited as precedents today and have had a formidable impact on key legislation such as New Deal welfare programs. In this sustained and thoughtful examination, Newmyer concentrates on his subject's ideas more than his personality or his life's chronology. The author plainly approves of Marshall as a man, a thinker and a judge, and this account will persuade readers that the judge is indeed worthy of study and admiration. 27 b&amp;w illus. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Webster&#39;s 3rd New International Dictionary: Of the English Language/Indexed/Imperial Buckram/Unabridged</h2><p>Nearly half a million entries provide standard and variant pronunciations, etymologies, comprehensive definitions, updated usage illustrations, and synonym articles</p><p>If big is better, the unabridged <i>Webster's Third New International Dictionary</i> is among the best.

"The jury is still out," writes Dick Teresi, whose intriguing survey of the non-Western roots of modern science offers several worthy arguments that Copernicus in fact ripped off Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. Common belief is that Westerners have been the mainspring of most scientific and technical achievement, but in <i>Lost Discoveries</i> Teresi shows that other cultures had arrived at much of the same knowledge at earlier dates. The Babylonians were using the Pythagorean theorem at least 15 centuries before Pythagoras drew his first triangle, and in A.D. 200 a Chinese mathematician calculated an incredibly accurate value for pi. The Mayans and other Mesoamericans were outstanding sky watchers and stargazers. The greatest advances occurred in math and astronomy, though Teresi also devotes chapters to physics, geology, chemistry, technology, and even cosmology. Sometimes he is a bit overeager to ascribe great thoughts to long-dead people (he casually suggests that "many ancient cultures had inklings of quantum theory"), but on the whole his book is a reliable and fascinating guide to the unexplored field of multicultural science. <i>--John J.

The <i>New Yorker</i> magazine sent Hannah Arendt to cover the trial. While covering the technical aspects of the trial, Arendt also explored the wider themes inherent in the trial, such as the nature of justice, the behavior of the Jewish leadership during the Nazi R�gime, and, most controversially, the nature of Evil itself. <p> Far from being evil incarnate, as the prosecution painted Eichmann, Arendt maintains that he was an average man, a petty bureaucrat interested only in furthering his career, and the evil he did came from the seductive power of the totalitarian state and an unthinking adherence to the Nazi cause. Indeed, Eichmann's only defense during the trial was "I was just following orders." </p><p> Arendt's analysis of the seductive nature of evil is a disturbing one. We would like to think that anyone who would perpetrate such horror on the world is different from us, and that such atrocities are rarities in our world. But the history of groups such as the Jews, Kurds, Bosnians, and Native Americans, to name but a few, seems to suggest that such evil is all too commonplace. In revealing Eichmann as the pedestrian little man that he was, Arendt shows us that the veneer of civilization is a thin one indeed.</p>Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) was an influential German political theorist and philosopher whose works include The Origins of Totalitarianism, The Human Condition, and Eichmann in Jerusalem.</p><h2>Gardner&#39;s Art through the Ages: Backpack Edition, Book E: Modern Europe and America</h2><p>GARDNER&#39;S ART THROUGH THE AGES, BACKPACK EDITION: BOOK E: MODERN EUROPE AND AMERICA is part of a six-book set that provides you with a comprehensive, beautifully-illustrated tour of the world&#39;s great artistic traditions!

But was the &#x201c;mechanical horse&#x201d; truly destined to usher in a new era of road travel or would it remain merely a plaything for dandies and schoolboys? In <i>Bicycle: The History </i>(named by <i>Outside</i> magazine as the #1 book on bicycles), David Herlihy recounts the saga of this far-reaching invention and the passions it aroused. The pioneer racer James Moore insisted the bicycle would become &#x201c;as common as umbrellas.&#x201d; Mark Twain was more skeptical, enjoining his readers to &#x201c;get a bicycle. You will not regret it&#x2014;if you live.&#x201d;<br><br> Because we live in an age of cross-country bicycle racing and high-tech mountain bikes, we may overlook the decades of development and ingenuity that transformed the basic concept of human-powered transportation into a marvel of engineering. This lively and engrossing history retraces the extraordinary story of the bicycle&#x2014;a history of disputed patents, brilliant inventions, and missed opportunities. Herlihy shows us why the bicycle captured the public&#x2019;s imagination and the myriad ways in which it reshaped our world.</p></p><p><p>A Conversation With David Herlihy</p> <p></p> <p>Q: What was the impact of the invention of the bicycle?</p> <p>A: The bicycle had a substantial technological impact. It is not an exaggeration to say that the bicycle business of the 1890s spawned the automotive industry. During the peak year of production in 1896 some three hundred firms in the United States alone produced nearly two million bicycles, and many of these companies went on to make automobiles using the same highly advanced production systems. Many automotive pioneers, including Henry Ford, started out working with bicycles. And bicycle technology also helped produce the first airplanes. The Wright brothers were bicycle mechanics; they used bicycles for wind tunnel experiments and built the Wright Flyer in their workshop.</p> <p>Q: What about the social impact of the bicycle?</p> <p>A: The bicycle changed social life in all sorts of ways�for women in particular it provided a justification to dress more sensibly and a means to travel without supervision. And in the early twentieth century, when cars were still prohibitively expensive, millions of working-class people relied on the bicycle for everyday transportation. This is still the case in the developing world. And of course the bicycle has long provided healthy and fun exercise to people of all ages and backgrounds.</p> <p>Q: You&#x2019;ve spent most of your life riding and writing about bicycles. What is it about the bicycle that has held your fascination for so long?</p> <p>A: My passion for bicycles began when I was a teenager in the 1970s, when America discovered lightweight European ten-speeds. For several years I lived in Italy, where I experienced the excitement of owning and riding a high-quality racing bike. The thrill of moving and balancing on two wheels is nearly as old as the bicycle itself�even in its crudest forms in the nineteenth century, the bicycle stirred passion and fired the imagination. It represented the spirit of the age�a determination to use technology to improve the human condition.</p>"David Herlihy is a widely recognized expert on the history of the bicycle, and this book offers the most comprehensive account to date of the bicycle and its development from a novelty for the elite to transportation for the masses. Frequently wry and always intelligent, Herlihy takes us on a marvelous tour of the bicycle&#x2019;s fascinating history."&#x2014; Peter Joffre Nye, U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame and co-author of The Lance Armstrong Performance Program <p>"Bicycle is a fascinating book.

These pictures of everyday people still speak to us today, 40 years and several generations later.</p><p>Armed with a camera and a fresh cache of film and bankrolled by a Guggenheim Foundation grant, Robert Frank crisscrossed the United States during 1955 and 1956. The photographs he brought back form a portrait of the country at the time and hint at its future. He saw the hope of the future in the faces of a couple at city hall in Reno, Nevada, and the despair of the present in a grimy roofscape. He saw the roiling racial tension, glamour, and beauty, and, perhaps because Frank himself was on the road, he was particularly attuned to Americans' love for cars. Funeral-goers lean against a shiny sedan, lovers kiss on a beach blanket in front of their parked car, young boys perch in the back seat at a drive-in movie. A sports car under a drop cloth is framed by two California palm trees; on the next page, a blanket is draped over a car accident victim's body in Arizona.<p> Robert Frank's Americans reappear 40 years after they were initially published in this exquisite volume by Scalo. Each photograph (there are more than 80 of them) stands alone on a page, while the caption information is included at the back of the book, allowing viewers an unfettered look at the images. Jack Kerouac's original introduction, commissioned when the photographer showed the writer his work while sitting on a sidewalk one night outside of a party, provides the only accompanying text. Kerouac's words add narrative dimension to Frank's imagery while in turn the photographs themselves perfectly illustrate the writer's own work.</p><b> Select Praise for the 50th Anniversary Edition of Robert Frank, <i>The Americans</i>:</b> <br><br> "Photography was never the same after <i> The Americans</i>. Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander and Nan Goldin all walked through the door Frank opened. And his influence was by no means limited to art photography. Fashion ads, music videos, movies- everyone stole from Frank". <br> <b> Malcolm Jones, <i> Newsweek</i> </b> <br> <br> "One of the greatest photography books of the 20th century." <br> <b> Richard Lacayo, <i> TIME</i> </b> <br><br> "Frank's genius was to see America unfiltered, much like Walker Evans and Dorthea Lange. There are no tricks here, no posing or false glory, just a sense of desolation." <br> <b> David Ulin, <i> Los Angeles Times</i> </b> <br><br> <i> "The Americans </i> reflects the mood of a turbulent decade, when postwar euphoria was giving way to racial tension and anti-Communist paranoia. But it's not just remarkable for its subject matter. The book offered a new visual language for photography: an intimate, off kilter aesthetic that's been imitated so many times that it seems obvious. In 1958, in an era of Tupperware and Hula-Hoops, it was far from obvious. Like its contemporary Beat-era poetry and novels, <i> The Americans </i> was a blast of authenticity, a potent artistic statement, a revelation." <br> <b> Sarah Coleman, <i> Planet</i></b> <br><br> "To mark the book's fiftieth anniversary, Steidl has published a new edition, complete with Kerouac's introduction, making <i> The Americans </i> the most famous photography book all over again." <br> <b> Nicole Rudick, <i> Bookforum </i></b></p><h2>Francis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma</h2><p>A biography of the British modern artist, famous for starting the informal &#34;School of London&#34;, which favored figurative painting in an age of abstract painting</p><p>This frank portrait of Anglo-Irish painter Francis Bacon (1909-92) contains enough juicy details about his lurid sex life and hard partying to satisfy even the most avid consumers of art-world gossip.

These activities might seem irresponsibly escapist, but history tells another story. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, when Sherlock Holmes became the world's first "virtual reality" character, readers began to colonize imaginary worlds, debating serious issues and viewing reality in provisional, "as if" terms rather than through essentialist, "just so" perspectives. From Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos and Tolkien's Middle-earth to the World of Warcraft and Second Life, <i>As If</i> provides a cultural history that reveals how we can remain enchanted but not deluded in an age where fantasy and reality increasingly intertwine.</p><p><i>"</i>Readers will have much to learn from Saler's work. <i>As If</i> is a very welcome contribution to the unfolding challenge of seeing how our newfound age of virtuality changes what we notice about the potential and actual virtuality woven into earlier forms of realist and fantastical fiction, in all their multifariousness." -- John Plotz, <i>Victorian Studies</i><br><b>Michael Saler</b> is Professor of History at the University of California, Davis.

Those fireside chats, characterized by a disarming frankness and an informal and conversational tone, represent an unprecedented presidential attempt to achieve intimacy with the nation. The American people listened, gathered around their radios in living rooms and kitchens across the country, as President Roosevelt discussed virtually every major problem facing the United States at home and abroad&#x2015;including both the gravest domestic struggle since the Civil War and perhaps the most serious foreign crisis in the nation&#x2019;s history. In the fireside chats the president touched upon all of the issues surrounding the depression and the New Deal, and upon the events, fears, and hopes that were part of the American experience of World War II.</p> <p>Editors Russell D. Buhite and David W. Levy have gather the fireside chats tighter for the first time in a single volume and, by careful attention to recordings and stenographic reports, present the speeches exactly as Roosevelt spoke them. A general introduction discusses the importance of Roosevelt in American political history, the rise of the radio as a political tool, and the way Roosevelt, aided by speech writers and advisers, prepared and delivered the chat. Issues of the day are explored in two additional introductory essays&#x2015;one describing the domestic situation Roosevelt confronted as he entered the White House in March 1933; the other surveying the international scene during the late 1930s, when Hitler, Mussolini, and Japanese militarists propelled the world toward a catastrophic war.</p> <p>To read the fireside chats a half century after they were delivered is to reenter a world of economic disaster, social reform, and international danger. It is also to hear, once again, the voice of one of the most skilled speakers and trusted leaders in American history.</p></p><p><p><strong>Russell D.

Decades of work by modern paleontologists have indeed brought us amazing fossils from far beyond the Cambrian, from the depths of the Precambrian. Yet hidden in these depths is a great mystery--something happened around the Cambrian to dramatically speed up evolution and produce many of the early forms of animals we know today--and scientists don't really know what provided that spark. <br> <br> In this vibrantly written book, Martin Brasier, a leading paleontologist working on early life, takes us into the deep, dark ages of the Precambrian to explore Darwin's Lost World. Brasier is a master storyteller. As he explains what we now know of the strange creatures of these truly ancient times--540 million years ago--he takes readers to many far flung places around the globe, interweaving an engaging account of cutting-edge science with colorful and amusing anecdotes from his expeditions to Siberia, Outer Mongolia, and other remote places. As he shows, decoding the evidence in these ancient rocks--piecing together the puzzle of the Cambrian Explosion--is very challenging work. What they have discovered is that, just at the beginning of the Cambrian period, animals (mostly worms) began burrowing into the mud. Why they suddenly began burrowing, and how this might have changed the atmosphere, may be important clues to the mystery. Brasier gives his own take on the emerging answers, as one of the leading players in the field.<br> <br> A richly readable account of far-flung expeditions and leading-edge science, <em>Darwin's Lost World</em> is a must-have book for all natural history buffs.</p><p><br><strong>Martin Brasier</strong> is Professor of Paleobiology at the University of Oxford.

Complete and unabridged.</p><p><i>Frankenstein,</i> loved by many decades of readers and praised by such eminent literary critics as Harold Bloom, seems hardly to need a recommendation. If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

But the question of how we understand the British Empire--its origins, nature, purpose, and effect on the world it ruled--is far from settled. <br> In this incisive new work, already being hailed as a landmark, David Cannadine looks at the British Empire from a new perspective--through the eyes of those who created and ruled it--and offers fresh insight into the driving forces behind the Empire. Arguing against the views of Edward Said and others, Cannadine suggests that the British were motivated not by race but by class. The British wanted to domesticate the exotic world of their colonies and to reorder the societies they ruled according to an idealized image of their own class hierarchies. In reestablishing the connections between British society and colonial society, Cannadine shows that Imperialists loathed Indians and Africans no more nor less than they loathed the great majority of Englishmen and were far more willing to work with maharajahs, kings, and chiefs of whatever race than with "sordid" white settlers. Revolted by the triumph of democracy in Britain itself, the Empire's rulers embraced a feudal vision of the colonies which successfully endured until the 1950s. <br> Written with verve, clarity, and wit--and characterized throughout by highly original thinking--<em>Ornamentalism</em> will fundamentally alter the way we view the British Empire.</p><p><br><strong>David Cannadine</strong> is Professor of History and Director of the Institute of Historical Research at London University. He is the author of many acclaimed books including <em>The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy, Class in Britain</em>, and <em>History in Our Time</em>. He lives in London.<br><br>"A thoughtful and spirited book.... In the privacy of their small worlds, away from the postmodernists and the radical historians writing 'peripheral' history, there can be heard fond retrospects of the empire and its pageantry by ordinary, unfashionable men and women. Were these people to tell us what they recall of the empire's doings, I suspect that they would echo some of the truths of Cannadine's subtle and learned retrieval of that imperial history."--Fouad Ajami, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Like everything that Cannadine writes...<em>Ornamentalism</em> is vigorous, stimulating, and bursting with ideas.... It should be read by anyone who is interested in politics and society in the British Empire."--Philip Ziegler, <em>The Spectator</em><p></p><br>"Cannadine is excellent on the uses of pageantry and on the kitschy extremes it had reached by the nineteen-twenties."--<em>New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"David Cannadine's <em>Ornamentalism</em> is so stimulating and original that it will now and forever after be read hand in hand with Edward Said's <em>Orientalism</em>. Cannadine's vision is quite different. He brilliantly recovers the world-view and social presuppositions of those who dominated and ruled the Empire, and thus restores the Empire to British social history. No other work succeeds as well in putting the history of Britain back into the history of the empire, and the history of the empire back into the history of Britain."--Wm.

It combines underlying theory with dozens of exercises designed to reveal the actor's craft. There is material on constructing the throughline, analyzing the script, character needs; the casting and rehearsal processes, film vs. theater procedures as well as the actor and the camera. <br><br>Distilling difficult concepts and a complex task to their simplest form, the author explains how to accurately capture and portray human behavior. The author's discussion of creative problems she has encountered or anticipated after years of experience, and her suggested solutions and exercises, are immediately useful. Additionally, hear what the actors have to say in excerpts from interviews with acclaimed actors such as Meryl Streep, Denzel Washington, Glenn Close, Robert Redford, Christopher Walken, Julianne Moore, and Michael Douglas (to name a few) who discuss their work with directors, what inspires them, and what they really want from the director. <br><br>* A well-known director and coach shares her secrets on getting great performances from actors<br>* Hands on; loaded with exercises<br>* Relevant to film, TV, and theater directors<br>* Foreword written by Ang Lee, Oscar-winning director of Brokeback Mountain and a student of DeKoven's</p><p>Written and endorsed by well-known theater and film professionals who know how well this unique, time-tested approach works!Lenore DeKoven has had a distinguished and varied career in film, theatre, and television.

It is told in the first person and is based on his own experiences during the First World War.</p><p>When it was published in 1932, this then-shocking and revolutionary first fiction redefined the art of the novel with its black humor, its nihilism, and its irreverent, explosive writing style, and made Louis-Ferdinand Celine one of France's--and literature's--most important 20th-Century writers. The picaresque adventures of Bardamu, the sarcastic and brilliant antihero of <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i> move from the battlefields of World War I (complete with buffoonish officers and cowardly soldiers), to French West Africa, the United States, and back to France in a style of prose that's lyrical, hallucinatory, and hilariously scathing toward nearly everybody and everything. Yet, beneath it all one can detect a gentle core of idealism.Louis-Ferdinand Celine (1894 - 1961) was one of the most controversial novelists of the twentieth century, a writer who mixed realism with imaginative fantasy and an iconoclast who shocked many of his readers.</p><h2>A Christmas Carol: Being a Ghost Story of Christmas</h2><p>An abridgment of the classic story with all the characters depicted as animals.</p><p>Purists may object to this careful abridgement of the holiday classic, aimed at young readers who may not have someone around to read the original out loud.

The charactersmice, rabbits, a reptilian Ghost of Christmas Yet to Comewill draw the youngest pre-Dickensian into the story. The gloomy mood of Scrooge's Christmas Eve gives way to warm, welcoming tints the morning after he is visited by the three Spirits and has learned his lesson.

This book integrates the problem of violence into a larger social science and historical framework, showing how economic and political behavior are closely linked. Most societies, which we call natural states, limit violence by political manipulation of the economy to create privileged interests. These privileges limit the use of violence by powerful individuals, but doing so hinders both economic and political development. In contrast, modern societies create open access to economic and political organizations, fostering political and economic competition. The book provides a framework for understanding the two types of social orders, why open access societies are both politically and economically more developed, and how some 25 countries have made the transition between the two types.</p><p>This book integrates the problem of violence into a larger social science and historical framework, showing how economic and political behavior are closely linked.

But is it true? What do we really know about the sexual lives of young people today?<br><br><em>Premarital Sex in America</em> combines illuminating personal stories and comprehensive research surveys to provide the fullest portrait of heterosexuality among young adults ever produced. Mark Regnerus and Jeremy Uecker draw upon a wealth of survey data as well as scores of in-depth interviews with young adults from around the country, both in and out of college. Digging underneath stereotypes and unexamined assumptions, the authors offer compelling--and often surprising--answers to such questions as: How do the emotional aspects of sexual relations differ between young men and women? What role do political orientations play in their sexual relations? How have online dating and social networking sites affected the relationships of emerging adults? Why are young people today waiting so much longer to marry? How prevalent are nontraditional forms of sex, and what do people think of them? To better understand what drives the sexual behaviors of emerging adults, Regnerus and Uecker pay special attention to two important concepts: sexual scripts, the unwritten and often unconscious rules that guide sexual behavior and attitudes; and sexual economics, a theory which suggests that the relative scarcity of men on college campuses contributes to the "hookup" culture by allowing men to diminish their level of commitment and thereby lower the "price" they have to "pay" for sex. <br><br>For anyone wishing to understand how sexual relations between young adults have changed and are changing, <em>Premarital Sex in America</em> will serve as a touchstone for years to come.<br></p><p><br><strong>Mark Regnerus</strong> is Associate Professor of Sociology and Religious Studies and Research Associate, Population Research Center, at the University of Texas, Austin.

But this book, which offers a wide-ranging guide to where we are now, could occasion some thinking about where we want to be." --<em>The New Republic</em> <br><p></p><br>"Mark Regnerus and Jeremy Uecker's <em>Premarital Sex in America: How Young Americans Meet, Mate, and Think About Marrying</em> draws from statistical analysis of several surveys and qualitative interviews." --<em>Contemporary Sociology</em> <br><p></p><br>"The book... studies a fairly narrow age range (18-23 years)... however, this age group has fascinated scholars and the public due to their ever-changing mindset and behaviors regarding sex. Thus, the book is geared toward those interested in understanding the complex topic of sexuality among those at the beginning of young adulthood. While many Mormon youth often abstain from premarital sexual activity, <em>Premarital Sex in America</em> offers an inside look into the large culture that LDS youth will encounter.

The very existence of consciousness, the author argues, poses a challenge to the traditional view of matter, as do the paradoxes of quantum theory. If mind as revealed in introspection, matter as manifested in observation and experiment, are to be seen as dual aspects of a unitary underlying reality, then a fundamental adjustment is called for in our understanding of mental and physical phenomena alike. The book demonstrates the need for a conception that is rooted both in the latest thinking about the foundations of quantum mechanics and in some previously neglected ideas of Bertrand Russell. Its implications are far-reaching and startlingly at odds with the conventional way of looking at the world and at the place of mind within it.</p><p></p><h2>Dynamic Book Physics, Volume 2: For Scientists and Engineers</h2><p>Great condition.

In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Peter M. Higgins, a renowned popular-science writer, unravels the world of numbers, demonstrating its richness and providing an overview of all the number types that feature in modern science and mathematics. Indeed, Higgins paints a crystal-clear picture of the number world, showing how the modern number system matured over many centuries, and introducing key concepts such as integers, fractions, real and imaginary numbers, and complex numbers. Higgins sheds light on such fascinating topics as the series of primes, describing how primes are now used to encrypt confidential data on the internet. He also explores the infinite nature of number collections and explains how the so-called real numbers knit together to form the continuum of the number line. Written in the fashion of Higgins' highly popular science paperbacks, <em>Numbers</em> accurately explains the nature of numbers and how so-called complex numbers and number systems are used in calculations that arise in real problems.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter M. Higgins</strong> is Professor and Head of the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Essex University. The author of five popular mathematics books, he is the inventor of Circular Sodoku.<br>coridial guide to number theory * The Guardian *</p><h2>Song of Exile: The Enduring Mystery of Psalm 137</h2><p>Oft-referenced and frequently set to music, Psalm 137 - which begins "By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion" - has become something of a cultural touchstone for music and Christianity across the Atlantic world. It has been a top single more than once in the 20th century, from Don McLean's haunting Anglo-American folk cover to Boney M's West Indian disco mix. In<em> Song of Exile</em>, David Stowe uses a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary approach that combines personal interviews, historical overview, and textual analysis to demonstrate the psalm's enduring place in popular culture.<br><br>The line that begins Psalm 137 - one of the most lyrical of the Hebrew Bible - has been used since its genesis to evoke the grief and protest of exiled, displaced, or marginalized communities. Despite the psalm's popularity, little has been written about its reception during the more than 2,500 years since the Babylonian exile. Stowe locates its use in the American Revolution and the Civil Rights movement, and internationally by anti-colonial Jamaican Rastafari and immigrants from Ireland, Korea, and Cuba. He studies musical references ranging from the Melodians' <em>Rivers of Babylon</em> to the score in Kazakh film <em>Tulpan</em>. <br><br>Stowe concludes by exploring the presence and absence in modern culture of the often-ignored final words: "Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones." Usually excised from liturgy and forgotten by scholars, Stowe finds these words echoed in modern occurrences of genocide and ethnic cleansing, and more generally in the culture of vengeance that has existed in North America from the earliest conflicts with Native Americans.<br><br>Based on numerous interviews with musicians, theologians, and writers, Stowe reconstructs the rich and varied reception history of this widely used, yet mysterious, text.<br></p><p><br><strong>David W. Stowe</strong> teaches English and Religious Studies at Michigan State University, where he is interim chair of the English Department. His most recent book is<em> No Sympathy for the Devil: Christian Pop Music and the Transformation of American Evangelicalism</em>. His previous book, <em>How Sweet the Sound:</em> <em>Music in the Spiritual Lives of Americans</em>, won the Deems Taylor Award from ASCAP.<br><br>"Stowe's study of Psalm 137 is one of the best examples of reception history written for nonspecialists, a riveting investigation that takes the reader into surprising places of American culture and beyond [I]t proves to be nothing short of eye opening."--William P. Brown, <em>Interpretation</em><p></p><br>"[A] very attractive and diverting read...Stowe succeeds in shedding light on a very attractive and essential text of the Bible..."--<em>The Expository Times</em><p></p><br>"This fascinating study examines the surprisingly wide-ranging and persistent reception of Psalm 137 in popular culture throughout the world...Anyone interested in the history of biblical interpretation and the Bible in popular culture will find this a rewarding read."--<em>The Bible Today</em><p></p><br>"David Stowe's focus is on subsequent, even contemporary use of the psalm, what we now call 'reception history.' Readers will be astonished by the rich inventory of belated uses of the psalm that Stowe has provided, mostly musical and in contexts of anguish. The psalm is now impressively contemporary with its pulses of pathos, resolve, and a will for vengeance."-Walter Brueggemann, Professor Emeritus of Old Testament, Columbia Theological Seminary <br><p></p><br>"Breathtaking! David Stowe's dazzling gloss on Psalm 137 and its compelling transit across centuries of American and European cultural, religious, and musical life is a wondrous testament to learning, curiosity, and the power of enthralling narrative. <em>Song of Exile</em> uplifts the power of words as few books do, a haunting exercise of scholarship and moral imagination."--Jon Butler, Howard R Lamar Professor Emeritus of American Studies, History &amp; Religious Studies, Yale University <br><p></p><br>"In this elegant account of Psalm 137 and its textual and musical reception, David Stowe marshals extraordinary erudition and interpretive imagination to fashion a probing inquiry into the perennial human experience of exile. <em>Song of Exile</em> invites readers to ponder history, memory, vengeance, forgiveness, and forgetting as classically expressed in the Psalmist's lyric 'By the Waters of Babylon' and movingly explored by Stowe's commentary on its afterlife from the biblical era to our own times."--Stephen A. Marini, Elisabeth Luce Moore Professor of Christian Studies, Wellesley College <br><p></p><br>"Stowe's historical approach to Psalm 137, 'By the rivers of Babylon/ There we sat down/ And there we wept/ When we remembered Zion' follows a lyrical trajectory from its original context through various political movements such as the U.S. Revolutionary War and the civil rights movement."--<em>Library</em> <em>Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"A gem of lyrical prose and expansive erudition, <em>Song of Exile</em> lays out a comprehensive vision of the reception of Psalm 137."--<em>Reading Religion</em><p></p><br>"Stowe's book maps the experience of the psalm to the experience of Israel and, in turn, to the experience of musicians, activists, preachers, and theologians throughout the centuries."--<em>Christanity Today</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Leadership for Evidence-Based Innovation in Nursing and Health Professions</h2><p>Where Evidence-Based Practice Meets Innovation<br><br>Healthcare organizations require both innovation and evidence-based practice to build systems that will support the future of improved care. Leadership for Evidence-Based Innovation in Nursing and Health Professions, Second Edition addresses the core competencies and behaviors required to be an innovative leader. This text fulfills the market need for an advanced practice resource focused on how to address new and emerging sources of evidence-based practice that can inform, translate and scale the complexity of leading innovation in healthcare organizations. The Second Edition has been heavily revised and updated to refine the focus on leadership of innovation and place less foundational focus on evidence-based practice process. In addition to a strong revision to the organization and updated content, this unique text features three new chapters discussing workarounds as a source of innovation, performance improvement leadership vs. innovation methodology and the use of evidence in both, and a technology primer for nusing leaders.<br><br>Leadership for Evidence-Based Innovation in Nursing and Health Professions, Second Edition takes a patient-centered approach, discusses the perspectives on the dynamic of innovation and evidence as well as emerging competencies for leaders of healthcare innovation. To address the core competencies the text is expertly organized into four sections: Section 1 Addresses the current landscape of evidence in innovation, Section 2 Examines new sources of evidence including technology and big data, Section 3 Discusses strategies for measuring innovation at a variety of system levels, and Section 4 Provides strategies to synthesize and disseminate evidence to advance innovation in healthcare.</p><p>Director, Nursing Innovation, Kaiser Permanente, Nursing Faculty, The Ohio State University College of Nursing</p><h2>Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>Dr. Smil is the world's authority on nitrogenous fertilizer.</b></p><p>The industrial synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen has been of greater fundamental importance to the modern world than the invention of the airplane, nuclear energy, space flight, or television. The expansion of the world's population from 1.6 billion people in 1900 to today's six billion would not have been possible without the synthesis of ammonia.</p><p>In <i>Enriching the Earth</i>, Vaclav Smil begins with a discussion of nitrogen's unique status in the biosphere, its role in crop production, and traditional means of supplying the nutrient. He then looks at various attempts to expand natural nitrogen flows through mineral and synthetic fertilizers. The core of the book is a detailed narrative of the discovery of ammonia synthesis by Fritz Haber&#x2015;a discovery scientists had sought for over one hundred years&#x2015;and its commercialization by Carl Bosch and the chemical company BASF. Smil also examines the emergence of the large-scale nitrogen fertilizer industry and analyzes the extent of global dependence on the Haber-Bosch process and its biospheric consequences. Finally, it looks at the role of nitrogen in civilization and, in a sad coda, describes the lives of Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch after the discovery of ammonia synthesis.</p></p><p>Vaclav Smil is Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Manitoba. He is the author of forty books, including <i>Energy and Civilization</i>, published by the MIT Press. In 2010 he was named by <i>Foreign Policy</i> as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers. In 2013 Bill Gates wrote on his website that &#x201c;there is no author whose books I look forward to more than Vaclav Smil."<p>I am tremendously impressed with this book. It will make a very significant contribution to the literature on the Haber-Bosch processof nitrogen synthesis, but perhaps even more significant, to putting into perspective the importance of nitrogen fertilizer to humanity.</p>&#x2015;<b>E. T. York</b>, Chancellor Emeritus, University System of Florida, and Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus, Institute of Food and Agriculture Sciences, University of Florida<br><br><p>The history of an industrial process that creates ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen sounds at best boring. However, in his sixteenth book, Vaclav Smil has done his usual outstanding job of creating a fascinating reading adventure. Starting with the statement that almost two thirds of the global population owes its existence to the discovery of the Haber-Bosch process in the early 20th century, the book reviews the history of the discovery, provides, fascinating details about the driving forces behind the discovery, and as important, looks to the future. Anyone with an interest in how humans modify their environment will find this book fascinating.</p>&#x2015;<b>James N.

Vaclav Smil makes the case instead for the Haber-Bosch process, which allows industrial synthesis of ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen and provides the foundation of our human food supply. his detailed story of the scientific trail that led to development of this process and its global impact is both enjoyable to read and an important contribution to the history of modern science and technology.</p>&#x2015;<b>Kenneth G.

Covering a vast amount of ground - from traditional themes such as images of God, spiritual direction and pilgrimage to more contemporary issues, such as place and space, cyberspace and postcolonialism -&nbsp;the author takes an ecumenical, inclusive stance, allowing the book to be used in a wide variety of courses and across denominations.</p></p><p><p>David B.

Furthermore, such texts rarely make adequate connections between reading and writing as well as reading and language acquisition--and they disregard linguistic diversity altogether. This book is different. </p> <p><i>Multiple Voices, Multiple Texts</i> provides a thorough grounding in the principles and practices of reading, writing, and language development--the kind of grounding teachers need for today's multicultural and multilingual classrooms. It is an innovative text based upon the principles of whole language and the interactive classroom, laying a theoretical framework derived from psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and social constructivism. Once Dornan, Rosen, and Wilson articulate their theory of reading, they offer practical suggestions for creating your own structures within this framework. They outline strategies for choosing and evaluating appropriate texts, innovative lesson plans that can be used across the curriculum, and new approaches for assessing student's reading needs. </p> <p>This book is an essential reference for undergraduate and graduate students taking courses in reading in the content areas, English education students in methods courses, students in reading and literacy studies, classroom teachers, and teacher educators.</p></p><p><p>Reade Dornan teaches English education in the Department of English at Michigan State University.

Of the fifty-four stories in the present volume, only thirty-five were published in his lifetime. Most of the rest appear in this collection for the first time.</p> <p>Crowley was a successful critic, editor and author of fiction from 1908 to 1922. Like their author, his stories are fun, smart, witty, thought-provoking and sometimes unsettling. They are set in places in which he had lived, and knew well: Belle Epoque Paris, Edwardian London, pre-revolutionary Russia and America during the First World War.</p> <p>The title story The Drug stands as one of the first accounts -- if not the first -- of a psychedelic experience. His Black and Silver is a knowing early noir discovery that anticipates an entire genre. Atlantis is a masterpiece of occult fantasy that can stand with Samuel Butler's Erewhon. Frank Harris considered The Testament of Magdalen Blair the most terrifying tale ever written. This second edition adds several additional stories, including the Qabalistic allegory Ambrosii Magi Hortus Rosarum, featuring the author's previously unpublished annotations.</p> <p>Extensive editorial end-notes give full details about the stories.</p></p><p></p><h2>The King&#39;s Two Bodies</h2><p><p>In 1957 Ernst Kantorowicz published a book that would be the guide for generations of scholars through the arcane mysteries of medieval political theology. In <i>The King's Two Bodies</i>, Kantorowicz traces the historical problem posed by the "King's two bodies"--the body politic and the body natural--back to the Middle Ages and demonstrates, by placing the concept in its proper setting of medieval thought and political theory, how the early-modern Western monarchies gradually began to develop a "political theology.?</p><p>The king's natural body has physical attributes, suffers, and dies, naturally, as do all humans; but the king's other body, the spiritual body, transcends the earthly and serves as a symbol of his office as majesty with the divine right to rule. The notion of the two bodies allowed for the continuity of monarchy even when the monarch died, as summed up in the formulation "The king is dead. Long live the king."</p><p> Bringing together liturgical works, images, and polemical material, <i>The King's Two Bodies</i> explores the long Christian past behind this "political theology." It provides a subtle history of how commonwealths developed symbolic means for establishing their sovereignty and, with such means, began to establish early forms of the nation-state.</p><p> Kantorowicz fled Nazi Germany in 1938, after refusing to sign a Nazi loyalty oath, and settled in the United States. While teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, he once again refused to sign an oath of allegiance, this one designed to identify Communist Party sympathizers. He was dismissed as a result of the controversy and moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he remained for the rest of his life, and where he wrote <i>The King's Two Bodies</i>.</p></p><p><b>Ernst H. Kantorowicz</b> taught at the University of California, Berkeley and was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey. His books include <i>Frederick the Second</i> and <i>Selected Studies</i>."Professor Kantorowicz has written a great book, perhaps the most important work in the history of medieval political thought, surely the most spectacular, of the past several generations. Here, in superbly designed chapters based upon the best scholarship in every field even remotely concerned with the Middle Ages, is the development of the theory and symbolism of the early national states from the eleventh to the sixteenth centuries."<b>---P. N. Riesenberg, <i>American Political Science Review</i></b><br><br>"Professor Ernst Kantorowicz has in this volume given us a monumental work of superb scholarship and profound learning, magnificently produced by Princeton University Press.

She explores the role of the guilds and the nobility, the unique island setting, the environment of the church and the private home, the political rivalries with other states, the taste for symbols and metaphorsQthe myriad qualities that made Venice distinct and its art unique.

And yet there remains a previously undiscovered aspect of his career: his surprisingly significant role as a draftsman. This book is the first to focus on Monet&#x2019;s pastels, drawings, and sketchbooks, offering a revolutionary new interpretation of the artist&#x2019;s life and work.<br>Monet has long been seen as an anti-draftsman, an artist who painted his subjects directly and whose rarely seen graphic works were marginal to his artistic process. In an effort to develop his public image, Monet denied the role of drawing in his working method. In actuality, Monet began his career as a caricaturist and as a teenager developed a passion for drawing that was never extinguished. He went on to master the medium of pastel and included seven in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874.<br>Citing recently discovered, unpublished documents that overturn the accepted image of the artist, <i>The Unknown Monet</i> reveals an extensive group of graphic works created over the course of the artist&#x2019;s career, many of which are unknown to the general public and to scholars: beautiful pastels, stunning black chalk drawings, and fascinating sketchbooks, which include pencil studies that relate to many of his paintings. The book also shows how Monet exploited the print media to promote his art.<br>The most important publication on Monet to appear in a generation, this illuminating volume is essential to anyone interested in his work, Impressionism, and nineteenth-century French culture.</p><p><p>James A.

It is written in a spare, indeed broken and often ungrammatical Finnish, in a school notebook where pages of prose alternate with lists of verbs, exercises in Finnish grammar and bits cut out from the Helsinki telephone directory. Some pages are illegible, others contain just sequences of words without any apparent logic, drawings, foreign names, and headlines taken from the "Helsingin Sanomat&#x201d;. Often the narrative proceeds by way of scraps cut out from newspapers, repeated each time a similar situation occurs, and fleshed out by others, in a wide variety of linguistic registers. My knowledge of the facts which lay behind this document has enabled me to reconstruct the story that it tells, to rewrite it in more orthodox language and to fill in some of the gaps. I myself have often had to intervene, adding linking passages of my own to tie up unrelated episodes. Adjectives left in the margins, nouns doggedly declined in the more complex cases of the Finnish language, all traced the outlines of a story which was well-known to me. In this way I have been able to coax these pages to yield up something that they were struggling in vain to tell. Using the scalpel of memory, I carved out words which ached like wounds I had believed to be long healed. Since I bore witness to many of the events and conversations recorded here, I have been able to piece them accurately together. In this I was greatly helped by Miss Ilma Koivisto, a nurse in the military medical corps who, like myself, was personally acquainted with the author of these pages.</p><h2>A Pig In Provence: Good Food and Simple Pleasures in the South of France</h2><p><p>Georgeanne Brennan moved to Provence in 1970, seeking a simpler life.

Flynn drives away his friends and family when his hobby becomes overly malodorous and fears that he will never be able to change his wheys. Children&#39;s BOMC.</p><p>"There was an old man named Wallace P. Flynn / Who lived in a house in the trees-- / You could smell him for several miles downwind / Because of his fondness for cheese." So begins silver-tongued storyteller Garrison Keillor's comical rhyming story <i>The Old Man Who Loved Cheese</i>. Mr. Flynn doesn't like mild cheese--he likes the stinkiest cheese available: "Some men want fame and their name on marquees. / Some men love money. <i>I choose cheese</i>," he proclaims to his frankly fed-up family. They scatter like leaves, and with his family gone, Mr. Flynn's life deteriorates as he spends more and more time at Easy Ed's Used Cheese Market. "The smell was so awful, so sour and vile / The skunks had to go and lie down for a while." It was only a matter of time before the cheese police moved in--smoking him out of his house with lemon meringue and butterscotch custard, both of which Mr. Flynn finds repulsive. In court, he finally agrees to forswear all cheese, convinced by the prospect of spending some time with his new grandson. Shortly after he is freed, he gets back together with his wife and they live happily ever after, <i>sans fromage</i>. Kids who laugh at all things smelly will certainly enjoy this rollicking tale, but it's perhaps even more suitable as comic relief for families experiencing the damaging effects of one family member's really bad habit. Illustrator Anne Wilsdorf's artwork is hilarious, cartoonish, appropriately gruesome, and jam-packed with details that adults and children alike will relish. (All ages) <i>--Karin Snelson</i>With a whiff of limburger and a touch of Lake Wobegon, humorist Keillor (Cat, You Better Come Home) serves up the story of Wallace P. Flynn, a man so enamored of smelly cheese that he is arrested by the Cheese Brigade of the Diet Patrol for smelling up the neighborhood. When brought to trial, Flynn is saved by the family that had long since deserted him; now his son persuasively pleads, "Why devote your life to cheese/ When you can have a grandbaby on your knees?" The moral??"a person can choose/ To mend his ways and to begin/ A brand-new life,/ As Mr. Flynn did with his wife." Wilsdorf's antic and lively drawings are a perfect accompaniment to a story peopled with eccentrics who shoot butterscotch custard and sticky buns out of cannons and relatives who run off to Arkansas ("which has a Halitosis Law"). The rhymes are unexpected and clever: "Guccis" with "blue cheese," "overseas" with "jujubes," and the hero declaims, "From now on, this shall be my goal: a/ Life of zero Gorgonzola." The slapstick comedy and outlandish plot notwithstanding, the inconsistent meter and constantly changing rhyme scheme sometimes sound like a weak imitation of Dr. Seuss. Still, Keillor's fans know that a book whose hero buys his best cheese at "Easy Ed's Used Cheese Market" will, like "a nice sharp cheddar/ [make them] feel a whole lot better!" All ages.<br><i>- feel a whole lot better!" All ages. </i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Demian: The Story of Emil Sinclair&#39;s Youth (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b><b>A powerful new translation of Nobel Prize winner Hermann Hesse&#x2019;s masterpiece of youthful rebellion&#x2014;with a foreword and cover art by James Franco<br><br>A Penguin Classic<br><br></b></b>A young man awakens to selfhood and to a world of possibilities beyond the conventions of his upbringing in Nobel Prize winner Hermann Hesse&#x2019;s beloved novel <i>Demian.</i> Emil Sinclair is a quiet boy drawn into a forbidden yet seductive realm of petty crime and defiance.

It was the beginning of summer, I had turned nineteen in April, and I was working at a caf� on the UCLA campus, selling deli sandwiches, microwaved pizza, cheap Mexican hash, and glistening Chinese. I had spent the previous school year studying English literature but had recently taken the plunge into the raging sea of film acting and was freshly making my way through the tide pools of acting school. I had not auditioned for the UCLA theater program and thus had been forced to take classes in the Valley, and just before the spring quarter at UCLA had ended I decided to devote myself full time to acting. My parents didn&#x2019;t object, saying only that they would support me as long as I studied at the university, but if I wanted to be an artist I had to find my own way.</p> <p> Working at the north campus eatery, I was serving the students who once had been my classmates. My boss was a graduate student with a shaved head except in two spots that he dyed red and gelled into six-inch horns. I&#x2019;ll call him Bill. I remember liking Bill if only because he was closer to my age than any boss I&#x2019;d ever had, but he was still a boss. I was working to support my dream (one of a few) to become a film actor, and my employer looked like the devil.</p> <p> On my breaks I read plays by O&#x2019;Neill, Tennessee Williams, Shaw, Ibsen, Chekhov, and anyone else who might help me understand my chosen profession. It turned out that the grinding aspect of the job was not Bill&#x2019;s constant watch as I loaded meat and mustard on sandwiches or scooped chili rellenos from the tin, depending on the day of the week; it was the boredom. I know now that I learned much about responsibility, dedication, and service from that humble job, but back then I had dreams of grandeur. I had left school in order to become the best actor in the world, and here I was, back on campus serving the very people who had been inviting me to frat parties a few months prior. I seemed to have taken five steps backwards, and the fact that I had left a top-rated university to join an army of hopefuls trying to break into a famously competitive industry often seemed like a fool&#x2019;s quest.</p> <p> On the wall next to the pizza service section was a framed photo of an elderly Marlon Brando being led by a man in a suit and a football helmet through a throng of photographers and gawkers. I&#x2019;m pretty sure it was taken around the time of Brando&#x2019;s son&#x2019;s murder trial, but it inspired me as I served the slop: Brando was the pinnacle of film acting, and his picture was a reminder of the great tradition I hoped to be a part of.</p> <p> After a couple months I started reading <i>Demian</i>. I&#x2019;m not sure if there was a connection, but one day, without warning, I hung up my apron and walked out the back, never to return. I had planned to work that day, so once taking my exit I didn&#x2019;t know where to go. With <i>Demian</i> folded in my pocket, I headed into Westwood, full of the passion of what I had done. On the edge of campus I ran into one of my former classmates, a girl I once had flirted with, sunning herself on the grass. I told her what had happened, but it didn&#x2019;t seem to register. I felt like I had taken another step away from a conformist life and another step toward artistic freedom, but, talking to her, I sounded to myself like I was an immature kid who had quit his job.</p> <p> At a caf� I jumped back into <i>Demian</i>, and I felt like I was understood again. Emil Sinclair, the narrator, is also on a search. His vacillation between good and bad, between expected pursuits and his own artistic path, seemed to mirror mine. Like so many young people in the ninety years since its publication, I felt like Hermann Hesse was describing my own interior and exterior struggles. Sinclair had Demian to help guide him, but I had yet to find my artistic mentor.

Latest edition available only from Amazon! <br> <p> <br> This is the story of young American boys, at the beginning of World War II, that came from every part of the country to Aviation Cadet centers in the major cities of the U.S.A. with high hopes of becoming pilots in the United States Army Air Forces; however, very few would achieve that goal. Only those with above average coordination, hearing, eyesight and physical stamina would be chosen to continue toward their goal. However, the elimination process would continue many times over,and only a select few would achieve their dream of wearing a pair of Silver Wings. The fighter pilot is the lone wolf. He is the only one in the cockpit of his plane. What ever goes wrong he must fix it, If the weather closes in and he gets lost, he is the only that can get him home. But he also must be a team player and the team is his squadron. Fighter pilots have been around since World War I, but now, during World War II, a new and complicated task has been added, some fighter pilots now have to carry bombs and perfect the technique of placing that bomb on an enemy target that is killing our ground troops or destroying our tanks. He must do this regardless of how much antiaircraft fire is coming his way. So now we have a new name to add to the list of warriors, The Fighter-Bomber Boys. From the war in Europe only about three thousand could carry that distinct title. They fought at treetop level, not at five miles above the earth. They lived in tents with mud floors, ate from mess kits, wore G.I. boots, slept in sleeping bags, and were more associated with the ground war than the air war with its massive bombing raids over Germany. If you like war books, this is one you should not miss.</p></p><p><p><b>Air Power History, </b><b>Spring 2007 </b></p> <p>&#x201c;[P-47 Pilots] provides a valuable and much-needed account of the important role played by tactical air forces. Glenn speaks with the indelible authority of one who has been in the middle of events he boldly describes. Vividly capturing for his reader the true essence of what it was like to have fought &#x2013; often at tree-top level &#x2013; over the battlefields of Europe during World War II, the importance of his work quickly comes into focus. It provides the historical record with a primary account of the combat conditions and experiences encountered by the tactical air forces during the allied operations in Europe in the waning days of the war.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>The Dreyfus Affair: &#34;J`Accuse&#34; and Other Writings</h2><p>In September 1894 the French authorities intercepted a letter which they claimed emanated from a Jewish army captain, Alfred Dreyfus, which they claimed to be proof of espionage on behalf of Germany. Dreyfus was subsequently court-martialed and imprisoned on Devil's Island, and the efforts of his family to have him released provoked an anti-Semitic controversy that split the French intellectual world down the center. Most famous among the participants was France's greatest living novelist, Emile Zola. This book is the first to provide, in English translation, the full extent of Zola's writings on the Dreyfus affair. It represents, in its polemical entirety, a classic defense of human rights and a searing denunciation of fanaticism and prejudice. <br><br>The book opens with the complete text of "J'Accuse," Zola's public letter to the French authorities. It also includes impassioned "open letters" to leading French newspapers, interviews with Zola at his home, intimate letters to his wife and friends written during his year-long exile in England (a direct result of three trials and a prison sentence for his part in the defense of Dreyfus), and his final articles, written when Dreyfus was close to being pardoned. Zola's texts constitute a unique and outstandingly eloquent primary source that is essential for a complete understanding of the Dreyfus affair. They shed brilliant new light on the official mind of France and were crucial in reversing public opinion, securing a retrial, and ensuring Dreyfus's rehabilitation. The significance of Zola's cause&#x2014;and his scathing and passionate prose&#x2014;resonate from his time to ours.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchWritten in defense of the court-martialed French soldier Alfred Dreyfus, Zola's essay "J'accuse!" is one of the most famous pieces of rhetorical journalism ever published. This volume collects, for the first time in English, all of Zola's writings on the Dreyfus Affair. Zola's many essays and open letters balance a seething fury at injustice with unrelenting, fiercely logical assaults on Dreyfus's accusers. Balancing these polemics are Zola's poignant, sadly domestic letters home during the year he spent exiled in England after his 1898 libel conviction. Levieux's readable translation lets Zola's forceful, somewhat bombastic tone shine through. The volume is not really a history of the affair, and the notes by Pages (editor of the French edition of Zola's letters) are sparse. (A more comprehensive treatment is available in Jean-Denis Bredin's The Affair, Braziller, 1986.) Instead, the Yale volume is documentation of one man's extraordinary public efforts to clear another's name.

Digital sculptor Scott Spencer guides you through the full array of ZBrush tools, including brushes, textures and detailing. With a focus on both the artistry and the technical know-how, you'll learn how to apply traditional sculpting and painting techniques to 3D art while uncovering the "why" behind the "how" for each step. You'll gain inspiration and insight from the beautiful full-color illustrations and professional tips from experienced ZBrush artists included in the book. And, above all, you'll have a solid understanding of how applying time-honored artistic methods to your workflow can turn ordinary digital art into breathtaking digital masterpieces.</p><p><p><strong> Amazon Exclusive: Scott Spencer's Favorite ZBrush Tricks</strong><br></p> <p><br> <strong>1. Move your light often. </strong>When sculpting try and use the basic material instead of the matcap shaders. The basic material allows you to interactively light the surface as you work. This makes judging your forms much easier since you can see shadows moving across the surface.<br><br> <strong>2. Use specular highlights. </strong>When working make sure you have some level of specular shine on the surface material. Specular highlights allows you to easily see the high points of the sculpt as well as pick out the fine details of the surface texture.<br><br> <strong>3. Store morph targets. </strong> When adding high frequency details it is a good habit to store a morph target of the model with no high frequency details. This will allow you to use the morph brush as a kind of "detail eraser", blending out the skin texture partially or completely as you work.<br><br> <strong>4. Use custom alphas. </strong>While ZBrush has many wonderful alphas preinstalled, get in the habit of finding useful images and storing them as your personal alpha library. You can quickly build up an in-depth and original collection of skin textures. Not only will this help you avoid clich�d alphas, it will also help you learn about the various kinds of wrinkle and scale patterns in nature by looking at the reference you collect.<br><br> <strong>5. Create and use custom menus.</strong>Use the custom menu options under preferences to group your most used buttons and options in one personal menu. This menu can then be mapped with a hotkey and called up at the touch of a button from anywhere in the user interface. This is an incredibly useful tool for speeding up your working time.<br><br> <strong>6. Create and use hotkeys. </strong>Another method to increase speed is using hotkeys. ZBrush has default hotkeys which can be found in the tool tip when hovering over a menu option. You can change these keys and set new hotkeys by pressing control and clicking on a menu option. ZBrush will the ask you to press the key combination you wish to assign as a hotkey.<br><br> <strong>7. Combine extraneous subtools. </strong>Your subtool menu can quickly become cluttered with extraneous parts. Two separate eyeballs for example are unnecessary and just add to the length of the subtool menu. Using meshInsert to take one eyeball and combine it into the other reducing two subtools into one. This can also be accomplished with the ZBrush plug-in SubtoolMaster. For this to work make sure the two tools have the same number of subdivision levels. This will ensure that both models retail their multiple levels of resolution when combined.<br><br> <strong>8. Frequent the ZBrushCentral website. </strong>The ZBrush user community is one of the most supportive user communities I have encountered. Visit ZBrush Central for updates on new tools, techniques, and plug-ins as well as conversations with other artist seeking critique on their work. If you have a question, posting in the forum will get an answer for you in no time.<br><br> <strong>9. Use ZMapper to check UVs.</strong> ZMapper's morph UV function is a quick and easy way to verify the UV set on a particular ZTool. This can be extremely useful in a production pipeline where you need to verify UV coordinates before proceeding. By simply loading the ZTool into ZMapper and activating morphUV you can check for the correct UV layout as well as visually can for any obvious overlaps or errors in the UV shells.<br><br> <strong>10. Sketch in ZBrush. </strong>Using a ZBrush primitive or a generic mesh, sketch characters often. These don&#x2019;t have to be show reel pieces just little experiments in using the tools and learning about form. I do at least one sketch a day I never plan on showing publicly. This frees me to make mistakes and just relax. It also helps me learn new things about both using the ZBrush tools as well as sculpting form. Just like you may keep a private sketchbook for ideas and fragments, keeping a ZBrush sketch folder will help you stay active. It can also serve as a great source of inspiration when you want to pick up a rough character and take it to a finish.<br><br><strong>11. Use reference. </strong>Always have reference handy when working. I personally use photo of real people as well as figurative sculptures when I work. It is hard to go wrong referencing how Michelangelo, Bernini, or Giambologna approached a particular problem in figure sculpture when you work. By referencing the masters you will learn while your work benefits. It is also a good idea to do master copies in your spare time. By trying to copy your reference exactly, you learn an amazing amount about how an artist thought and dealt with specific problems.<br><br></p><p>Break Free from the 3D Mold</p> <p>ZBrush is taking the world of 3D modeling by storm, allowing CG artists to create spectacular organic models in a way that feels like traditional sculpting and painting.

Because the most popular<br>algorithms frequently change, it is increasingly important for researchers<br>and implementors to have a basic understanding of the principles of image<br>synthesis. Focusing on theory, Andrew Glassner provides a comprehensive<br>explanation of the three core fields of study that come together to form<br>digital image synthesis: the human visual system, digital signal<br>processing, and the interaction of matter and light. Assuming no more than<br>a basic background in calculus, Glassner transforms his passion and<br>expertise into a thorough presentation of each of these disciplines, and<br>their elegant orchestration into modern rendering techniques such as<br>radiosity and ray tracing.</p><p>Andrew Glassner's contributions to computer graphics span 20 years. His work at Microsoft Research, Xerox PARC, the IBM Watson Research Labs, Bell Communications Research, and the Delft University of Technology has produced numerous technical articles on rendering theory and practice, animation, modeling, and new media. He currently creates new computer graphics tools at Microsoft Research.

First, it includes Furhman's contemporaneous crime scene notes (with observations as meticulous as any TV sleuth's), which make mention of a "<i>visible fingerprint</i>" Furhman saw on the Bundy back gate (and discussed with his partner at the time). Second, it reveals that Lange and Vannatter, the detectives from "downtown" who took over the case from Furhman, didn't check out the print that night or subsequently, and indeed never read Fuhrman's notes at all. That's why you didn't hear about the fingerprint during the criminal trial. (When authorities returned to sample blood from the back gate two weeks later, the print was gone.) In short, the main lesson of this book is an organizational one worth remembering: it doesn't matter if the grunts do a good job, if the big-shots don't follow up.For O.J. Simpson to get away with murder, an innocent cop�a brilliant detective�had to be destroyed. That was the cynical strategy of the Simpson �Dream Team,&#x201d; and it worked. <br> <br>Now the former LAPD detective tells his side of the story in a damning expos� that reveals why and how Simpson&#x2019;s interrogation and prosecution were bungled. <br> <br>Mark Fuhrman&#x2019;s own hand-drawn maps of the crime scene and his reconstruction of the murders leave no doubt about what really happened on June 12, 1994. <br> <br> <i>Murder in Brentwood<i> sets the record straight.<br></i></i></p><h2>Book of Common Prayer (1979 Gift Edition)</h2><p>This edition of the <em>1979 Book of Common Prayer</em> features imitation leather binding, and is an ideal gift for celebrating special occasions.<br><br>The Gift Edition offers all of the unique supplementary features available in Oxford's prayer books - The Revised Common Lectionary, historical and theological background materials, answers to commonly asked questions about the church, and more.

May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p></p><h2>Dialectic of enlightenment (A Continuum book)</h2><p><i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i> is undoubtedly the most influential publication of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. Written during the Second World War and circulated privately, it appeared in a printed edition in Amsterdam in 1947. "What we had set out to do," the authors write in the Preface, "was nothing less than to explain why humanity, instead of entering a truly human state, is sinking into a new kind of barbarism." Yet the work goes far beyond a mere critique of contemporary events. Historically remote developments, indeed, the birth of Western history and of subjectivity itself out of the struggle against natural forces, as represented in myths, are connected in a wide arch to the most threatening experiences of the present. The book consists in five chapters, at first glance unconnected, together with a number of shorter notes. The various analyses concern such phenomena as the detachment of science from practical life, formalized morality, the manipulative nature of entertainment culture, and a paranoid behavioral structure, expressed in aggressive anti-Semitism, that marks the limits of enlightenment. The authors perceive a common element in these phenomena, the tendency toward self-destruction of the guiding criteria inherent in enlightenment thought from the beginning. Using historical analyses to elucidate the present, they show, against the background of a prehistory of subjectivity, why the National Socialist terror was not an aberration of modern history but was rooted deeply in the fundamental characteristics of Western civilization. Adorno and Horkheimer see the self-destruction of Western reason as grounded in a historical and fateful dialectic between the domination of external nature and society. They trace enlightenment, which split these spheres apart, back to its mythical roots. Enlightenment and myth, therefore, are not irreconcilable opposites, but dialectically mediated qualities of both real and intellectual life. "Myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment reverts to mythology." This paradox is the fundamental thesis of the book. This new translation, based on the text in the complete edition of the works of Max Horkheimer, contains textual variants, commentary upon them, and an editorial discussion of the position of this work in the development of Critical Theory.</p><p>Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno were two influential members of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory.Text: English (translation)</p><h2>Mathematics and Its History (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)</h2><p><p>From the reviews of the first edition: </p> <p>"[This book] can be described as a collection of critical historical essays dealing with a large variety of mathematical disciplines and issues, and intended for a broad audience� we know of no book on mathematics and its history that covers half as much nonstandard material.

The fact that the topics are introduced in their historical contexts will enable students to better appreciate and understand the mathematical ideas involved...If one constructs a list of topics central to a history course, then they would closely resemble those chosen here."</p><p>(David Parrott, Australian Mathematical Society)</p><p></p><p>"The book...is presented in a lively style without unnecessary detail.

It can be recommended for seminars and will be enjoyed by the broad mathematical community." </p><p>(European Mathematical Society)</p><p></p><p>"Since Stillwell treats many topics, most mathematicians will learn a lot from this book as well as they will find pleasant and rather clear expositions of custom materials.

Of the 450 easy-to-follow recipes culled from over 50 countries, more than 40% are new. Listed by their ethnic names, with English and phonetic pronunciation given, and quicker and easier to prepare than their original versions, recipes for these dishes, mostly down-to-earth country fare, retain their authenticity. Included are such well-known classics as French vegetable ragout (ratatouille), Russian salmon loaf (coulibiac), Irish stew and Swedish rye bread (limpa), as well as lesser-known African vegetable stew (vegetable biryani) and Hungarian fish with sour cream (betyar fogas). At heart a book intended for the uninitiated cook, the volume includes a glossary of foreign ingredients and terms, informative sidebar explanations, and a regional and general index.

In this vibrant new biography, Mark Ravina, professor of history and Director of East Asian Studies at Emory University, explores the facts behind Hollywood storytelling and Japanese legends, and explains the passion and poignancy of Saigo's life. Known both for his scholarly research and his appearances on The History Channel, Ravina recreates the world in which Saigo lived and died, the last days of the samurai. <p><i>The Last Samurai</i> traces Saigo's life from his early days as a tax clerk in far southwestern Japan, through his rise to national prominence as a fierce imperial loyalist. Saigo was twice exiled for his political activities -- sent to Japan's remote southwestern islands where he fully expected to die. But exile only increased his reputation for loyalty, and in 1864 he was brought back to the capital to help his lord fight for the restoration of the emperor. In 1868, Saigo commanded his lord's forces in the battles which toppled the shogunate and he became and leader in the emperor Meiji's new government. But Saigo found only anguish in national leadership. He understood the need for a modern conscript army but longed for the days of the traditional warrior.</p> <p>Saigo hoped to die in service to the emperor. In 1873, he sought appointment as envoy to Korea, where he planned to demand that the Korean king show deference to the Japanese emperor, drawing his sword, if necessary, top defend imperial honor. Denied this chance to show his courage and loyalty, he retreated to his homeland and spent his last years as a schoolteacher, training samurai boys in frugality, honesty, and courage. In 1876, when the government stripped samurai of their swords, Saigo's followers rose in rebellion and Saigo became their reluctant leader. His insurrection became the bloodiest war Japan had seen in centuries, killing over 12,000 men on both sides and nearly bankrupting the new imperial government. The imperial government denounced Saigo as a rebel and a traitor, but their propaganda could not overcome his fame and in 1889, twelve years after his death, the government relented, pardoned Saigo of all crimes, and posthumously restored him to imperial court rank.</p> <p>In <b>THE LAST SAMURAI</b>, Saigo is as compelling a character as Robert E. Lee was to Americans-a great and noble warrior who followed the dictates of honor and loyalty, even though it meant civil war in a country to which he'd devoted his life. Saigo's life is a fascinating look into Japanese feudal society and a history of a country as it struggled between its long traditions and the dictates of a modern future.</p></p><p>On September 24, 1877, Saig�&nbsp;Takamori, one of Japan's most loyal and honored samurai, died in the bloodiest conflict Japan had seen in over two hundred years, a battle led by Saig�&nbsp;and his band of loyal students. Now, more than 125 years after his death, Saig�&nbsp;still remains a legendary yet enigmatic figure in Japan. Why would Japan's greatest warrior, whose sole purpose was to serve his country, set in motion a civil war and lead a group of rebel soldiers to overthrow the government that he had personally helped to restore? The Last Samurai sets forth to demystify Saig�'s life, his machinations, and the dramatic historical events that shaped the life and death of Japan's favorite samurai. <p>Exiled for misconduct, Saig�&nbsp;was pardoned in 1864 and called back to the mainland to train a group of Satsuma warriors. Their mission was to seize control of the imperial palace and restore the imperial house to its former glory. Saig�'s coup was successful, and in 1867 he led the drive to destroy the shogunate and to create a powerful new state. But with Saig�'s victory came a crushing defeat: in his drive to modernize Japan, the Meiji emperor, whom Saig�&nbsp;had helped bring to power, abolished all samurai privileges, including their ancient right to carry swords.</p> <p>Now an acting member of a modernizing Meiji government, Saig�&nbsp;was given command of the new Imperial Guard, Japan's first national army in nearly a millennium. Saig�&nbsp;supported many of the government's Western-style reforms, but he was torn by the sense that he was betraying his most stalwart supporters. Deeply ambivalent about the government he had helped create, Saig�&nbsp;sought to end his career with a final dramatic gesture: he sought to go as imperial envoy to Korea, where he would insist that the Korean king recognize the Meiji emperor. When his plan was denounced as reckless, Saig�&nbsp;resigned from government, returned to his native Satsuma, and opened a military academy for former samurai warriors. His group of disgruntled students resented the rapid modernization of Japan even more than did Saig�. They set forth to slow the hand of change with their swords, making Saig�&nbsp;the reluctant leader of their uprising. Old Japan and New Japan met in battle-blades against artillery-and old Japan lost. Saig�&nbsp;died in battle from a bullet wound, but legend still has it that he died by his own sword, upholding samurai honor to the end.</p> <p>In life, Saig�&nbsp;had represented all that was commendable in the samurai estate. In death, Saig�'s legend grew even greater. The Last Samurai deftly traces the rise, fall, and rise again of Saig�'s life, his legend, and his dedication to all he believed in: tradition, honor, and glory. This compelling book provides a fascinating glimpse into the final days of Japanese feudal society, the blood-swept path of Saig�'s career, and his lasting impact on the nation to which he gave his life.</p>A brilliant warrior, reluctant rebel, and tragic figure caught between tradition and a changing world <p>0n September 24, 1877, Saigo-Takamori, one of Japan's most loyal and honored samurai, died in the bloodiest conflict Japan had seen in over two hundred years&#x2014;a battle led by Saigo- and his band of loyal students. Now, more than 125 years after his death, Saigo- still remains a legendary yet enigmatic figure in Japan. Why would Japan's greatest warrior, whose sole purpose was to serve his country, set in motion a civil war and lead a group of rebel soldiers to overthrow the government that he had personally helped to restore?</p> <p>Against the colorful and turbulent backdrop of Japanese feudal society, The Last Samurai chronicles Saigo&#x2013;'s life, from the childhood events that shaped his courage and passionate sense of justice to Saigo&#x2013;'s demise by his own hand on the battlefield of the Satsuma Rebellion. The Last Samurai offers a riveting account of the making of Japan's most honored samurai, details the tragic clash between his samurai ideals and Japan's transformation into a modern nation, and illustrates why this consummate soldier and reluctant rebel is still as revered today as he was in his time.</p> <p>"Ravina's writing grips with the intensity of a great adventure story and vividly portrays the upheavals caused to a nation."<br> &#x2014;Yorkshire Evening Post (UK)</p></p><h2>Fluid Power Technology (Andrew R.

Lewis cooked and wrote as a means to explore her memories of childhood on a farm in Freetown, Virginia, a community first founded by black families freed from slavery. With such observations as "we would gather wild honey from the hollow of oak trees to go with the hot biscuits and pick wild strawberries to go with the heavy cream," she commemorated the seasonal richness of southern food. After living many years in New York City, where she became a chef and a political activist, she returned to the South and continued to write. Her reputation as a trailblazer in the revival of regional cooking and as a progenitor of the farm-to-table movement continues to grow. In this first-ever critical appreciation of Lewis's work, food-world stars gather to reveal their&nbsp;own encounters with Edna Lewis. Together they penetrate the mythology around Lewis and illuminate her legacy for a new generation.<br><br>The essayists are Annemarie Ahearn, Mashama Bailey, Scott Alves Barton, Patricia E.

It&#x2019;s freewheeling fun.&#x201d; &#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly&nbsp;</i>(starred review)</b><br><b><br></b>Is there anything more splendid than a baby&#x2019;s skin? Cocoa-brown, cinnamon, peaches and cream. As children grow, their clever skin does, too, enjoying hugs and tickles, protecting them inside and out, and making them one of a kind. Fran Manushkin&#x2019;s rollicking text and Lauren Tobia&#x2019;s delicious illustrations paint a breezy and irresistible picture of the human family &#x2014; and how wonderful it is to be just who you are.</p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>PreS&#x2014;In this picture book for young children, Manushkin celebrates the different aspects of skin. It has many tones, from "cocoa brown," to "peaches and cream," and sometimes distinguishing features like freckles, birthmarks, or dimples. Skin "keeps the outsides out/and your insides in," scabs over wounds, tans in sun, and exhibits goose pimples in cold. While the brief rhyming text is occasionally strained, the large illustrations, executed in ink and pencil and digitally arranged, depict a mixed-race family as they interact with a delightful array of diverse babies, preschoolers, and their parents in their urban neighborhood. Adults kiss baby feet, hold little ones aloft, and snuggle with them. The park and neighborhood scenes include a girl in a wheelchair and Muslim and Orthodox Jewish families enjoying themselves outdoors. Among many humorous touches is a scene in which two youngsters display their paintings while readers see all the paint on the floor and walls and a dog streaking paint as it runs off with a brush. The story comes full circle, beginning with a baby, happy in its "brand-new" skin, and ending with parents and tired children, all "happy in [their] skin," coming home after celebrating with "bouquets of people" at a block party. VERDICT A delightful feel-good story that will be welcome in most collections.&#x2014;Marianne Saccardi, Children's Literature Consultant, Greenwich, CT</p><h2>Trauma Practice: Tools For Stabilization And Recovery</h2><p>Trauma Practice, now in its 3rd edition, is back by popular demand!

Commodus&#x2019;s passion for hunting animals was so fervent that he dreamt of shooting a tiger, an elephant, and a hippopotamus; his prowess was such that people claimed he never missed when hurling his javelin or firing arrows from his bow. For fourteen days near the end of AD 192, the emperor mounted one of the most lavish and spectacular gladiatorial games Rome had ever seen. Commodus himself was the star attraction, and people rushed from all over Italy to witness the spectacle. But this slaughter was simply the warm-up act to the main event: the emperor was also planning to fight as a gladiator.</p><p>Why did Roman rulers spend vast resources on such over-the-top displays&#x2015;and why did some emperors appear in them as combatants? Why did the Roman rabble enjoy watching the slaughter of animals and the sight of men fighting to the death? And how best can we in the modern world understand what was truly at stake in the circus and the arena? In <i>The Day Commodus Killed a Rhino</i>, Jerry Toner set out to answer these questions by vividly describing what it would have been like to attend Commodus&#x2019; fantastic shows and watch one of his many appearances as both hunter and fighter. </p><p>Highlighting the massive logistical effort needed to supply the games with animals, performers, and criminals for execution, the book reveals how blood and gore were actually incidental to what really mattered. Gladiatorial games played a key role in establishing a forum for political debate between the rulers and the ruled. Roman crowds were not passive: they were made up of sophisticated consumers with their own political aims, which they used the games to secure. In addition, the games also served as a pure expression of what it meant to be a true Roman. Drawing on notions of personal honor, manly vigor, and sophisticated craftsmanship, the games were a story that the Romans loved to tell themselves about themselves.</p></p><p><p>In ancient times, the Roman games&#x2015;that heady cocktail of mass slaughter, gladiatorial combat, and chariot racing&#x2015;made strong political, social, and cultural statements.</p><p><b>Jerry Toner</b> is a fellow and the director of studies in classics at Churchill College, University of Cambridge.

It is not a book about God as God. As identifying the two words &#34;God&#34; and &#34;trauma,&#34; I wish to focus attention on the religious dimension of the psychology of those two overwhelming events we describe as traumatic.... Whether a divine being really exists or not, the psychological fact remains that we tend to experience traumatic events as if they were in some sense divine. Just as God has been described as transcendent and unknowable, a trauma is an event which transcends our capacity to experience it. Compared to the finite nature of the traumatized soul, the traumatic event since infinite, all-powerful, and wholly other. Again we cannot say that traumatic events literally possess these properties, but only that the traumatized soul propitiates them as if they did. ---from book&#39;s Introduction</p><p></p><h2>The Columbia Encyclopedia</h2><p>Includes thousands of biographies and articles on science, medicine, technology, agriculture, business, history, and art, and includes maps, charts, and diagrams.</p><p>The single-volume <i>Columbia Encyclopedia</i> was first published in 1935 as a "suitable companion to a good dictionary and atlas" for the general reader, and it still fits that description more than 75 years later. There are nearly 51,000 entries in this new edition, with 1,300 new entries and revisions made to 40 percent of the remainder. The preface states that efforts have been made to expand computer, medical, and science coverage, and this appears to be the case. Editor Lagasse credits an able editorial board and contributors, as well as the dozens of consultants and academic advisors responsible for the content and accuracy of the fifth edition, on which this work is based.Since the last edition was published, in 1993, the Web has exploded into daily culture. This is reflected throughout the book, in articles as diverse as <i>Book publishing</i>, <i>Broker</i>, <i>Newspaper</i>, <i>Postal service</i>, <i>Speculation</i>, <i>Store</i>, and <i>Telecommuting</i>. (Indeed, the full text of the new <i>Columbia Encyclopedia</i> is available free on the Internet [http://www.bartleby.com/65/].) <i>Global warming</i> and <i>Artificial </i>intelligence have been expanded. <i>Mine</i> has been updated with statistics, recent treaties, and mine-removal operations; and <i>Lyme </i>disease mentions the human vaccine approved in 1999. Other new entries: <i>Antidepressant</i>; <i>Blair, Tony</i>; <i>Dietary mineral</i>; <i>Dove, Rita</i>; <i>DVD</i>; <i>Echinacea</i>; <i>Reconnaissance satellite</i>; and <i>Triathlon</i>. Political events from 1999 have been added to many articles: <i>Australian Aborigines</i> reflects the government apology for mistreatment, <i>Chechnya</i> discusses the establishment of Islamic law, and polls showing declining support for secession are noted in <i>Quebec</i>. The table for Nobel Prize winners is current through 1999.Any major encyclopedia will always have a few errors, and this one is no exception. The 1997 change in family classification for skunks to Mephitidae is not mentioned (they're still described as part of the Mustelid, or weasel, family). The Longfellow Mountains shown marching across the Maine state map are a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains; the name is of historical interest, but it's not part of the common knowledge of hikers and residents, nor is it used on current maps from most standard publishers.Entries range in length from a sentence or two to several pages, which means a great number of words given the extremely small font size utilized. Two welcome improvements have been made to the layout of longer articles: division into indented paragraphs for the first time, and more subsection headings. Cross-references (80,000 of them) are found throughout the text of articles (e.g., to <i>Drug resistance</i> from <i>Antibiotic</i>), and <i>see </i>references (e.g., <i>I-Ching</i> SEE <i>Book of Changes</i>) are adequate. In the Web edition, these are hypertext links, which is very convenient. Many articles include a short bibliography of books, often listed only by author and year in the interest of saving space. Another note on the font: the editors have switched from a sans-serif to a more readable serif font for the article text. There is no handy thumb index in the new edition.Maps are included for countries and U.S. states and vary widely in the amount of detail provided. For example, some countries, such as Italy, get a full-page map with major cities and geographic features identified, while others, such as Botswana, are represented by a tiny darkened area on a small map of the continent, on which the capital city is not even indicated. Get out that world atlas! Tables and charts (e.g., for elementary particles, U.S. presidents, United Nations members, the periodic table, the manual alphabet, constellations) are used where appropriate. Line drawings aid understanding of articles such as <i>Cone</i>, <i>Gear, Jet propulsion</i>, <i>Kepler's second law</i>, <i>Methionine</i>, <i>Orders of architecture</i>, and<i> Panpipes</i>. Some choices seem odd: why illustrate <i>Mint</i> but not <i>Potato</i>? The Internet edition includes tables but not the maps and drawings found in the print volume.Even though the Internet version has the dual advantages of keyword searching and font enlargement, most libraries will still want to have the latest <i>Columbia Encyclopedia</i> in the reference or reading room. Put it on a well-placed, sturdy stand, and it's likely to get more action than the Web site will ever attract. REVWR<br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

After Labor Day, the politicians had all returned to D.C., the left-wing Hollywood/media types to L.A. and New York. Also gone were the smug, privileged frat boys, many of whom imagined themselves Democrats but who in the fullness of time would become mainstream Republicans. Half of Lincoln&#x2019;s Las Vegas agency&#x2014;or what was left of it after the Great Recession&#x2014;was made up of Sigma Chis who&#x2019;d been long-haired pot smokers and war protesters in the sixties and seventies. Now they were hard-line conservatives, or anyway harder than Lincoln. These days, a lifelong Republican himself, Lincoln had a difficult time finding comfort anywhere on the political spectrum. Voting for Hillary was out of the question, but if not her, then who? A baker&#x2019;s dozen of GOP candidates were still in the race&#x2014;some legitimately stupid, others acting like it&#x2014;at least through Iowa. So Kasich, maybe. Bland wouldn&#x2019;t be so bad. Think Eisenhower.<br><br> Anyway, a relief to shelve politics for a few days. Lincoln had little doubt that Teddy, who would arrive tomorrow, was still a raging lib, though there was no way of telling whether he&#x2019;d be in the Clinton or the Sanders camp. Mickey? Did he even vote? Probably not a bad idea to give Vietnam a conversational miss, as well. The war had been over for decades, except not really, not for men of their age. It had been their war, whether or not they&#x2019;d served. Though his memory was increasingly porous these days, Lincoln still remem�bered that evening back in 1969 when all the hashers had gathered in the back room of the Theta house to watch the draft lottery on a tiny black-and-white TV someone had brought in for the occasion. Had they asked permission to watch on the big TV in the front room? Probably not. The social boundaries of sororities, like so much else in the culture, had started eroding, as evidenced by their regular Friday afternoon hasher parties, but they could still crop up unexpectedly. Hashers still entered the house through the rear. Anyway, the draft wasn&#x2019;t about the Thetas, it was about Lincoln and Teddy and Mickey and the others. Eight young men whose fortunes that night hung in the balance. A couple were dating Thetas, as Lincoln would the following year with Anita, and planned to see them later in the evening, but they&#x2019;d watch the lottery on the crappy little set in the back room, not the big color one in the front room, because they belonged there, as did the war itself.<br><br> They&#x2019;d made a party of it, everybody chipping in for a case of beer&#x2014;strictly against the rules, but Cook wouldn&#x2019;t squeal, not that night. The rule was that you couldn&#x2019;t start drinking until your birthday had been drawn and you knew your fate. Mickey&#x2019;s came first, shockingly early. Number 9. How was it that Lincoln could recall this detail, when time had relegated so much else to memory&#x2019;s dustbin? He remembered, too, how his friend had risen to his feet, his arms raised like a victorious boxer, as if he&#x2019;d been hoping for precisely this eventuality. Going over to the aluminum tub, he&#x2019;d pulled a beer out of the ice, popped the top and chugged half of it. Then, wiping his mouth on his sleeve, he&#x2019;d grinned and said, &#x201c;You boys must be feeling pretty dry in the mouth right about now.&#x201d; The other thing Lincoln recalled was glancing over at Teddy and seeing that all the blood had drained out of his face.<br><br> Absent from these vivid memories, though, was how he&#x2019;d com�ported himself. Had he joined the others in serenading Mickey with the Canadian national anthem? Had he laughed at the god-awful jokes (&#x201c;Been nice knowin&#x2019; ya, Mick&#x201d;)? He had a dim, perhaps false, memory of taking Mickey aside at some point and saying, &#x201c;Hey, man, it&#x2019;s a long way off.&#x201d; Because even those who&#x2019;d drawn low numbers probably wouldn&#x2019;t hear from their draft boards for months, and college students were allowed to finish that academic year. Most juniors in good standing&#x2014;as Lincoln, Teddy and Mickey were&#x2014;would get one-year deferments to complete their degrees before reporting for duty. Maybe by then the war would be over or, failing that, winding down.<br><br> Later that evening Lincoln called home, hoping his mother would answer, though naturally it was his father who picked up. &#x201c;We watched,&#x201d; he said, his nasal, high-pitched voice exaggerated by the tinny, long-distance connection. &#x201c;Like I told your mother, they won&#x2019;t go beyond one-fifty.&#x201d; As with all his father&#x2019;s opinions, this one was expressed as fact. <br><br> &#x201c;Unless you&#x2019;re wrong and they do,&#x201d; Lincoln said, emboldened, perhaps, by being three thousand miles away. <br><br> &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not and they won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Dub-Yay had assured him, prob�ably to allay Lincoln&#x2019;s fear, though he sometimes wondered if his father&#x2019;s pronouncements served some other, more obscure purpose. Ever since his mother let him in on the truth about their family finances, his father&#x2019;s declarations had begun to tick him off. &#x201c;How did the other Stooges make out?&#x201d; Dub-Yay wanted to know. (Lin�coln had told his parents that he and Teddy and Mickey, so unlike the preppy Minerva boys with rich parents, had come to think of themselves as the Three Musketeers, to which his father had imme�diately responded, &#x201c;Three Stooges would be more like it.&#x201d;) <br><br> Lincoln swallowed hard. &#x201c;Mickey got nailed. Number nine.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a foolish war,&#x201d; his father conceded. &#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t get to hold out for a just one.&#x201d;<br><br> Lincoln supposed he agreed, but it still annoyed him that his father would be so cavalier where his friends were concerned. &#x201c;What would you say if I went to Canada?&#x201d; Lincoln ventured. <br><br> &#x201c;Not one blessed thing.&#x201d; This statement was delivered without hesitation, as if Dub-Yay had been anticipating the question, given it some serious thought and was anxious, as always, to share his conclusions. &#x201c;The moment you did that, you would no longer be my son, and we wouldn&#x2019;t be speaking. I didn&#x2019;t name you after Abraham Lincoln so you could become a draft dodger. How fared Brother Edward?&#x201d;<br><br> That was his nickname for Teddy, who&#x2019;d visited them in Dun�bar that summer. Lincoln&#x2019;s mother had liked him immediately, but Dub-Yay hadn&#x2019;t been impressed. It was W. A. Moser&#x2019;s deeply held conviction that a single round of golf would reveal everything you needed to know about a man&#x2019;s character, and he had made up his mind about Teddy on the first tee when he failed to remove his wristwatch. Nothing pleased Wolfgang Amadeus more than to extrapolate the world from a grain of sand. In retrospect, though, Lincoln doubted the wristwatch incident had anything to do with his misgivings about his friend. More likely Teddy had said some�thing provocative about the war or remarked that all the members of the Dunbar Country Club were white and the staff Latino.<br><br> &#x201c;Teddy&#x2019;s safe,&#x201d; Lincoln said. &#x201c;Three hundred&#x2013;something.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Just as well. I can&#x2019;t imagine what earthly use that boy would be in combat.&#x201d; <i>Or anything else, </i>he seemed to be saying.<br><br> Had Lincoln even spoken to his mother that evening? Here again, memory, like a conscientious objector, refused to serve.<br><br> What <i>was </i>etched vividly in Lincoln&#x2019;s brain, however, was the moment when all three Musketeers emerged from the Theta house and found their beautiful d&#x2019;Artagnan shivering in the December cold out back. Just as he remembered the shameful thought that had entered his head unbidden&#x2014;<i>You lucky dog!</i>&#x2014;when she took a surprised Mickey in her arms and hugged him tight. You had only to glance at Teddy to know he was thinking the same thing.<br><br> Jacy. Vanished from this very island. Memorial Day weekend, 1971.</p><h2>The Insect Societies (Belknap Press)</h2><p>This first comprehensive study of social insects since the 1930s includes more than 250 illustrations and covers all aspects of classification, evolution, anatomy, physiology, and behavior of the social insects&#x2015;social wasps and bees, ants, termites. Since the publication of W. M. Wheeler&#x2019;s <i>The Social Insects</i> in 1928 and Franz Maidl&#x2019;s <i>Die Lebensgewohnheiten und Instinkte der staatenbikdenden Insekten</i> in 1934, the literature on social insects has increased enormously, and new ways of studying insect societies have developed. Edward O. Wilson reinterprets the knowledge of the subject through the concepts of modern biology&#x2015;from IOC chemistry to evolutionary theory and population ecology. He reviews the evolution of parental care and other primitive forms of social behavior throughout the arthropods and includes full coverage of various forms of symbiosis between the social insects and other anthropods. He also compares insect and vertebrate societies in basic theoretical terms, showing how a unified sociobiology is possible if developed as a branch of population biology.</p><p>Edward O. Wilson is Pellegrino University Professor, Emeritus, at Harvard University. In addition to two Pulitzer Prizes (one of which he shares with Bert H�lldobler), Wilson has won many scientific awards, including the National Medal of Science and the Crafoord Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.&#x201c;If only because of the rarity of the event and the stature of the author...<i>The Insect Societies</i> must be considered a work of major importance. It is certain to influence the focus of research as well as the content of public information on the social insects for years to come...For anyone, layman or specialists, interested in a single, concise, lucid, and authoritative account of the most significant facts and theories about insect societies, <i>The Insect Societies</i> is the best available and will be for many years.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mary Jane West Eberhard</b><b>, </b><b><i>Natural History</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Because ants, wasps, bees, and termites are of importance to man, because of their ecological domination of the land, and because their activities remind man of his own, this encyclopedic work will attract the general reader, students, and biologists as well as entomologists...This comprehensive work must be recognized as an outstanding contribution to biological literature.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Insect Societies</i> gives an extraordinarily complete and up-to-date account of the natural history of social insects with their great proliferation of genera, species, and behavioral types...In these fields modern genetics, selection theory, and biomathematics are being developed to explain the evolution of insect societies and their diversity both in size and in longevity. This is one of the growing points in the study of social insects and an undertaking to which Wilson is making important contributions.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>O. W. Richards</b><b>, </b><b><i>Science</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In comprehensiveness of scope and modernity of outlook <i>The Insect Societies</i> can truly be said to be unique. For many years to come it will surely constitute a benchmark for all those, professional and amateur alike, for whom the social insects offer one of the most compelling and fascinating pageants in all the world of nature. The book is likely to become a collector's item.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Caryl F. Haskins</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The book is well illustrated, and written in a clear direct style, with such specialist technical terms as Wilson feels obliged to uses explained in a glossary; evidently he is anxious to reach a wider audience than that provided by professional entomologists--as indeed the book deserves to do...This handsome book will undoubtedly be widely read and influential.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>R. A. Crowson</b><b>, </b><b><i>Nature</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;No book on biology in the past 20 years has been as satisfying as this treatise on ants, bees, wasps and termites...It is written with clarity and verve, but what distinguishes it particularly is its catholic mastery of all of biology, from paleontology to formal genetics, from ethology to biochemistry. Nothing less can be an adequate basis for the study of our social colleagues on this earth, and nothing less has its courageous and energetic author settled for. Biology is a whole science, and here it is wholly seen...It is so honest and yet so rich that it attracts and holds by the scent of understanding.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Scientific American</i></b></p><h2>Haiku World: An International Poetry Almanac</h2><p>An international anthology featuring haiku poems from forty-five nations presents some one thousand examples of these stylized poems, appearing in both English and their original language and organized according to seasonal themes.</p><p>William J. Higginson studied Japanese at Yale University where he discovered the haiku, and served, with the U.S. Air Force in Japan. He is a charter member of the Haiku Society of America, founded in 1968, and edited and published Haiku Magazine (1971-76). He has three published collections of longer poems and one of haiku, and has work appearing in magazines and anthologies worldwide. He has also taught in the National Endowment for the Arts &#34;Poets-in-the Schools&#34; program, leading writing workshops in hundreds of schools, and he regularly speaks at conferences in the U.S., Canada, and Japan. Higginson&#39;s international anthology of haiku for children, Wind in the Long Grass, is a classroom favorite. His two-volume sequel to The Haiku Handbook, The Haiku Seasons and Haiku World, gives a comprehensive view of the history, present state, and international possibilities of seasonal consciousness in poetry.The Nature and Organization of This Book <p>Haiku World: An International Poetry Almanac includes over 1,000 poems originally written in 25 languages by more than 600 poets from some 50 countries. The poems are organized under 680 seasonal and nonseasonal topics. To summarize its main features: </p><p>1. For the first time in any language, Haiku World collects a substantial number of haiku and related poems by Japanese and non-Japanese poets on an equal footing in their most traditional setting, so that this poetry, originating in Japan but now composed and appreciated worldwide, may be seen by all parties as a truly global phenomenon. Thus, Haiku World provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in the latter decades of the twentieth century. </p><p>2. Haiku World shows how haiku and related poems written in all languages equally reflect the primary characteristics of the haikai genre. Arranging the poems by traditional topics allows each poem to join the global effort to see and appreciate the human and natural world, to become a part of the great chorus rather than remain isolated as a private solo. </p><p>3. Haiku World demonstrates the diversity and unity of the various poetries collectively known as haikai--haiku, senryu, and renku--with a broad sampling from all three. </p><p>4. Haiku World offers a selection of Japanese as well as non-Japanese haikai poems that apply to aspects of life beyond the borders of any specific season by including a nonseasonal section based on the deepest aspects of the tradition and on recent developments in constructing Japanese saijiki. </p><p>[The following excerpt is from the Saijiki, under "Winter: The Heavens," with some typographical adjustments.] </p><p>winter moon, fuyu no tsuki (all).

The house itself was a ruin, but I had to have that door. Over the years, I&#x2019;ve painted it many times, all different ways: abstract, representational, blue, black, brown. I&#x2019;ve painted it in the hot green of summer, in the dead of winter, clouds rushing past it, a lone yellow leaf drifting down. I painted the door open only once. Just before he died. In every picture after, it was closed.<br><br>This is not a love story. If it were, we would have the same story. But he has his, and I have mine. He used to say it all began with the charcoal abstractions I made in 1915 before I met him. I was twenty-seven, a schoolteacher, poor, driven only by a singular, relentless passion for my art. One night, I turned my back on everything I&#x2019;d learned about what art should be, I locked the door of my room and got down on the floor with large sheets of paper and charcoal. I remember the cool hush of the night through the window as shapes poured out of the nub of charcoal in my hand.<br><br>Finished, I rolled up the drawings and sent them to my friend Anita Pollitzer in New York. She brought them to Stieglitz at his gallery. When he saw them, he told her, &#x201c;These are the purest, fairest, sincerest things that have entered 291 in a long while.&#x201d;<br><br>I knew who he was&#x2014;everyone did. I&#x2019;d met him once before though he would not remember. The father of modern photography. An icon of American art. In groundbreaking shows at 291, Alfred Stieglitz had introduced New York to the work of Picasso and Matisse. A brilliant photographer in his own right, he was known more for the careers of the artists he&#x2019;d &#x201c;made.&#x201d;<br><br>I wrote to him at 291 and asked him to tell me what he saw in my charcoal drawings. He wrote back to say he wanted to show my work, I should send him more. We exchanged letters back and forth across the country. I spent every extra dollar on brushes, paper, paint.<br><br>Over the years, this would be the story he told, again and again, until it became The Story: those charcoals; his discovery of me; our correspondence that began shortly after. He would say I was what he had been waiting for. What he had always known was meant to exist.<br><br>Because Stieglitz used words with a certain unique force, his version of our story prevailed.<br><br>&#x201c;You will be a legend,&#x201d; he said to me once.<br><br>I laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I see it. It&#x2019;s already in you.&#x201d;<br><br>Legend. A word he would use again and again.<br><br>He had faith in me. He did not give me greatness, but his faith in my early work gave me the space to achieve it. He knew this then, and perhaps on some level he also knew that for me to fully become the legend he saw, I would have to leave him.<br><br>Tonight in New Mexico, so many years later, the air is clear. My sight is gone, but I know this view by heart. The ropy silvered turns of the road passing below my window, the shrubby heads of the cottonwoods, the river valley, the distant line of hills. The shapes of the world out there are shadowy. Lean and contoured strokes, they glow. The moon shines and cuts the night open.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a grain of truth to Stieglitz&#x2019;s version of things: The story of my art in his life did begin the moment he unrolled those charcoals. But to my mind, our story began more than a year later. I was still teaching, at a small college in Texas, sending him my pictures as I made them. A curious intimacy had begun to evolve in our letters.<br><br>It was late May 1917 when Stieglitz wrote to say he had hung a small show of my watercolors and charcoals. My first show. It would be 291&#x2019;s last. He was closing the gallery. The war. I felt my heart skip as I read those lines. What I&#x2019;d give to see my things on those walls.<br><br>For three days, I walked around with his letter in my pocket. Then I went to the bank manager&#x2019;s house on a Sunday and begged him to open, so I could withdraw the last two hundred dollars I had to buy a train ticket from Texas to New York.<br><br>I did not tell Stieglitz I was coming.<br><br>II<br><br>May 1917, New York<br><br>291. The walls are bare, already stripped. He looks up and when he sees me standing in the doorway, his face changes, softens to a simple pleasure, lit. &#x201c;Georgia.&#x201d;<br><br>He dismisses the two fellows he was speaking with.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve come all this way,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I had no idea you were coming to New York.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, I should have told you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your show was taken down two days ago. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>His eyes are dark, piercing through his bent spectacles, a kind of deep-set fire in them; his hair thick and wild, turning steel gray. He is in his mid-fifties, nearly twice my age.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are you staying?&#x201d; he says.<br><br>&#x201c;With a friend. Near Teachers College.&#x201d;<br><br>His eyes have not left my face. &#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; he says. He goes into the back room and reappears with two of my pictures.<br><br>&#x201c;Sit down.&#x201d; He gestures to a chair.<br><br>I shake my head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather stand.&#x201d;<br><br>He pauses. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t going to leave?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d;<br><br>He begins to hang my art, piece after piece. My watercolor skies, my charcoal landscapes of the canyon with the humped shapes of cows, my numbered blues. He hangs them exactly as he&#x2019;d placed them for the show. A sureness in how he handles them. Prophet. Seer. Giant of the art world. Iconoclast. The small room is hot. I can feel threads of sweat moving down my body, heat in my throat, in my hands.<br><br>He is married, I tell myself. A wife. A daughter. You&#x2019;re his artist. Nothing more.<br><br>I think back to a day in February, his letters were piling up&#x2014;sometimes five in a week&#x2014;I had begun to dread their coming. Began to dread even more the impatient hunger I felt for them to come. And on that day, in the one free hour I had between classes, instead of going to the post office to see what he had sent, I made myself not go. I bought a box of bullets instead, took my gun and some old tin cans, walked out across the plains, threw the cans onto the ground, and shot at them like I could blow that hunger right apart&#x2014;<br><br>Now, at 291, he strides past me. The gallery walls are no longer empty, as they were when I arrived. The room has sparked to life.<br><br>One piece does not hang straight. He crosses back to it and gently shifts the frame&#x2019;s edge to be just as he wants it. Then it is done. The room is very still. Light filters through the skylight to the floor.<br><br>He turns to me. &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; he says. My eyes flow slowly over the walls, over my art. &#x201c;You should have been here to see the whole show,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;You would have seen how it stunned them. I can&#x2019;t tell you how many times I had that thought: If only she were here.&#x201d; His voice drops. A nameless, burning thing between us. I laugh, an awkward laugh, but it breaks the spell and things are light again. I am light, and he is just a man. I walk with him through the room, looking at my pictures on the walls. We pause at a painting of the Palo Duro canyon&#x2014;the golden sloped walls, rimmed with fleecy clouds, wet blue sky in the upper right corner.<br><br>&#x201c;That country out there is entirely unlike New York, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;And you love it, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The sky is just so big. The distances. It&#x2019;s hard to describe. It reminds me of Sun Prairie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In Wisconsin?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Where I grew up.&#x201d;<br><br>Farmland rolling away, wheat like golden snow. But it was the sky I loved most&#x2014;the beautiful free waste of it. When chores on the farm were done, there was nothing to do but wander out into that sky.<br><br>We are still facing the picture of the canyon, standing near enough that I realize I could stretch my fingers and touch the point at his sleeve where the wrist disappears at the cuff.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s important that you work more in oil,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to&#x2014;you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oil is stubborn. I don&#x2019;t always like it.&#x201d;<br><br>He laughs. &#x201c;You will learn to.&#x201d;<br><br>It is the future he is speaking of.<br><br>He quotes from the critics, some of the reviews. I have already seen them. He sent them to me and, though I could not quite bear to read them, I notice the words live on his tongue: exile, privation, flowing, rise, mystical, in a sensitized line.<br><br>I am aware of him standing near me&#x2014;so near, it feels almost unsafe.<br><br>&#x201c;I want to photograph you with your pictures,&#x201d; he suddenly says. &#x201c;May I?&#x201d;<br><br>I nod. He goes into the back room and returns with the camera and tripod.<br><br>&#x201c;Stand there,&#x201d; he says, pointing to one of my blues. &#x201c;In front of that. No, not to the side, put it behind you. Make it the background of you.&#x201d;<br><br>Inch to the left, three inches forward, half an inch back. He knows what he wants. &#x201c;No, less. Turn your chin. Yes. That&#x2019;s it.&#x201d; He disappears behind the camera under the worn black cloth.<br><br>&#x201c;Look directly here.&#x201d; His voice snakes into the room like it is not his voice, but another&#x2014;softer, lower, streaming from the lens.<br><br>I can feel him, watching me, waiting, the other side of the camera, the silence of the room charged now as he waits for the light to shift and fall a certain way, an expression on my face that he is waiting for, he will wait until he has it.<br><br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Now. Whatever you are thinking, don&#x2019;t lose it. Don&#x2019;t move. Don&#x2019;t blink. Nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>The shutter clicks. I am counting. Counting. It takes so long&#x2014;but there&#x2019;s a kind of raw pleasure in holding still, like I am stone on the outside, my heart beating through my skin so deep and loud I&#x2019;m sure he will hear it. I&#x2019;m aware of his eyes behind the camera, the hot dark work of them, and I feel my body rise.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move,&#x201d; he whispers. &#x201c;Georgia.&#x201d;<br><br>III<br><br>I stay in New York for ten days. He invites me to lunch and we walk the streets, laughing, talking. The buildings seem to shimmer, spring sun striking off them. He tells me about Oaklawn, his family&#x2019;s summer home at Lake George&#x2014;how he always starts to feel the pull of it this time of year, in spring when the buds swell and the world is busting open.<br><br>&#x201c;I love the Lake the way you love your plains and sky.&#x201d;<br><br>I glance at him. A small white dog runs across the path in front of us, a child running after, long spindling legs churning. He talks about his daughter, Kitty, who will enter Smith College in the fall. He calls his wife Mrs. Stieglitz, a strain in the silence that follows.<br><br>He asks about my family. I talk about my four sisters: Catherine and Anita are married, Ida&#x2019;s a nurse; Claudie, the youngest, still in school, lives out in Texas with me. I don&#x2019;t talk about our father who turned to drink and disappeared. I don&#x2019;t mention my mother who died last spring.<br><br>We come to a man selling oranges and stop for one. I peel it as we walk, my fingers tacky with the juice.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you miss Texas when you&#x2019;re here?&#x201d; he asks.<br><br>&#x201c;Right now?&#x201d; I say lightly and smile. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>There is a push in the silence between us. I am keenly aware of the stink of the horses, the blare of the cars, voices passing, trees like green shadows. A carriage passes by.<br><br>&#x201c;You must continue to send me your things,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>&#x201c;Even with no gallery?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll find a way to show them. And you must send them carefully&#x2014;better packaging, more postage. They must arrive safe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to imagine there will be no 291.&#x201d;<br><br>I see him frown. &#x201c;There was no choice anymore. The war. The expense.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It just feels wrong that something with such meaning would not exist.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It will exist somewhere else. Just keep making your pictures and send them to me.&#x201d; He smiles then. &#x201c;You, Great Woman Child.&#x201d;<br><br>He has called me crazy things like this in his letters. &#x201c;How can I be both?&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Both Great Woman and Child. Tell me. I&#x2019;ve wondered this.&#x201d;<br><br>I expect him to laugh, but he doesn&#x2019;t.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what gives your art greatness,&#x201d; he says simply. &#x201c;You have what a child has&#x2014;a pure unpolluted instinct. What I call Whiteness. And you are a woman.&#x201d;<br><br>So casual&#x2014;how he uses that word, Greatness&#x2014;as if he&#x2019;s unfolding something I already know.<br><br>Back at 291, he introduces me to a few of his circle&#x2014;the men. There&#x2019;s the collector Jacob Dewald, the inventor Henry Gaisman, the painter Arthur Dove. They have already seen my pictures&#x2014;and are full of compliments and praise. I briefly meet John Marin, the best-known of Stieglitz&#x2019;s artists. He&#x2019;ll render smashed sunlight on a coast in forked block lines. When I first saw his work, it reminded me of Kandinsky.<br><br>Stiegtliz&#x2019;s newest prot�g�, Paul Strand, is also there. He has a work apron on, a hammer in his hand. He looks like a boy dressed up in someone else&#x2019;s costume. A solemn round face, blue eyes. He shows me one of his photographs of bowls&#x2014;four very ordinary kitchen bowls&#x2014;but cropped close up, disorienting.<br><br>&#x201c;So beautiful!&#x201d; I say. And it is&#x2014;how the curve of one bowl falls into the curve of the next&#x2014;a definite, near-perfect balance in resolute asymmetry.<br><br>&#x201c;A similar sense of feeling to your blue spiral, Georgia,&#x201d; Stieglitz says, coming over.<br><br>&#x201c;Different, though,&#x201d; I say.<br><br>&#x201c;How?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Here, in the bowls, the movement is happening in many directions at once. Not only one. The cropping intensifies that. It magnifies the motion and makes us believe it continues.&#x201d; I point at a shadow in the shape of a blade, sharply cropped, at the print&#x2019;s edge.<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly right,&#x201d; Stieglitz says, a beat of triumph in his voice, &#x201c;although I have to admit I myself didn&#x2019;t see it quite that way before.&#x201d; He looks at Strand, then at the others. They nod assent, his admiration echoed in their eyes, and in that moment I understand: There are things this man values in me, things he wants. He treats me as an equal, more than equal, and for that reason alone, others will see me that way.<br><br>On June 1, there is only rain, as if the city itself will pour away. I wake at dawn and watch the world outside slide down the window glass.<br><br>At the train station, Gaisman goes off to check the schedule. Stieglitz and I are alone on the platform. The ache is almost unbearable. A strand of hair falls across my eyes. He moves it.<br><br>&#x201c;Lovely, You,&#x201d; he says.</p><h2>The Luciano Project: The Secret Wartime Collaboration of the Mafia and the U.S. Navy</h2><p>Rodney Campbell&#39;s &#34;The Luciano Project: The Secret Wartime Collaboration of the Mafia and the U.S. Navy&#34; is a fascinating two-pronged history. The first story, as the subtitle indicates, has to do with the Navy&#39;s recruitment of the Luciano crime family to protect New York&#39;s waterfront (including the Brooklyn Navy Yard) from Nazi saboteurs and u-boats. After all, the government reasoned, who is better qualified to protect the docks than the people who have controlled them for decades? This was, as Campbell points out, very pragmatic. However, from a moral and legal view, this was extremely problemmatic.</p><p></p><h2>As I see it: The autobiography of J.

The time is the 1950s, and John Ames, the town&#39;s beloved pastor, is dying of heart disease. Widowed early but recently remarried, John has a very young son. The novel is a final act of love: a letter to the boy, in which</p><p>In 1981, Marilynne Robinson wrote <i>Housekeeping</i>, which won the PEN/Hemingway Award and became a modern classic. Since then, she has written two pieces of nonfiction: <i>Mother Country</i> and <i>The Death of Adam</i>. With <i>Gilead</i>, we have, at last, another work of fiction. As with <i>The Great Fire</i>, Shirley Hazzards's return, 22 years after <i>The Transit of Venus</i>, it was worth the long wait. Books such as these take time, and thought, and a certain kind of genius. There are no invidious comparisons to be made. Robinson's books are unalike in every way but one: the same incisive thought and careful prose illuminate both.<p> The narrator, John Ames, is 76, a preacher who has lived almost all of his life in Gilead, Iowa. He is writing a letter to his almost seven-year-old son, the blessing of his second marriage. It is a summing-up, an apologia, a consideration of his life. Robinson takes the story away from being simply the reminiscences of one man and moves it into the realm of a meditation on fathers and children, particularly sons, on faith, and on the imperfectability of man. </p><p> The reason for the letter is Ames's failing health. He wants to leave an account of himself for this son who will never really know him. His greatest regret is that he hasn't much to leave them, in worldly terms. "Your mother told you I'm writing your begats, and you seemed very pleased with the idea. Well, then. What should I record for you?" In the course of the narrative, John Ames records himself, inside and out, in a meditative style. Robinson's prose asks the reader to slow down to the pace of an old man in Gilead, Iowa, in 1956. Ames writes of his father and grandfather, estranged over his grandfather's departure for Kansas to march for abolition and his father's lifelong pacifism. The tension between them, their love for each other and their inability to bridge the chasm of their beliefs is a constant source of rumination for John Ames. Fathers and sons. </p><p> The other constant in the book is Ames's friendship since childhood with "old Boughton," a Presbyterian minister. Boughton, father of many children, favors his son, named John Ames Boughton, above all others. Ames must constantly monitor his tendency to be envious of Boughton's bounteous family; his first wife died in childbirth and the baby died almost immediately after her. Jack Boughton is a ne'er-do-well, Ames knows it and strives to love him as he knows he should. Jack arrives in Gilead after a long absence, full of charm and mischief, causing Ames to wonder what influence he might have on Ames's young wife and son when Ames dies. </p><p> These are the things that Ames tells his son about: his ancestors, the nature of love and friendship, the part that faith and prayer play in every life and an awareness of one's own culpability. There is also reconciliation without resignation, self-awareness without deprecation, abundant good humor, philosophical queries--Jack asks, "'Do you ever wonder why American Christianity seems to wait for the real thinking to be done elsewhere?'"--and an ongoing sense of childlike wonder at the beauty and variety of God's world.</p><p> In Marilynne Robinson's hands, there <i>is</i> a balm in Gilead, as the old spiritual tells us. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>Marilynne Robinson was born in 1947.

View her insightful and passionate analysis along with a condensed reading and student comments on the course. <p></p><p> The poetry collected in this volume reveals the range and power of the contemporary American imagination. The verve, freedom, and boldness of American English are combined with the new harmonies of modern cadence. Here are distillations of twentieth-century perception, feeling, and thought, and reflections of changing social realities, scientific and psychoanalytic insights, and the strong voices of feminism and black consciousness. This is a book for those who value fresh and original poetry and for readers worldwide who are curious about contemporary American experience. </p><p> Helen Vendler relies on her own taste and judgment in singling out excellent poems, beginning with the late modernist flowering of Wallace Stevens and continuing to the present. Her wide-ranging Introduction places recent American poetry in its aesthetic and social contexts. The anthology provides an extensive offering of the work of major poets and introduces many writers who are only now beginning to make their reputation. Thirty-five poets are included, with a representative selection from the earlier to later work of each and a significant number of long poems. Brief biographies of the poets are appended. </p></p><p><b>Helen Vendler</b> is A.

So, on the whole, are the poems. (Hugh Kenner <i>Boston Globe</i>)<br><br>Towards the end of her multi-faceted introductory essay, Helen Vendler says that she has made "a sampling of what to my taste seems satisfying" in the great flood of recent American poetry. Since she is one of the foremost critics of poetry in America, her taste has more than purely personal significance. In fact, her "sampling" amounts to a progress report on what has happened in American poetry from the 1950s to the present. (Peter Hainsworth <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>[Vendler] is at her best when discussing the history of formal changes within poems themselves. Her thoughts on endings, (i.e. contemporary release from resounding closure) are illuminating, ingeniously conceived as a "tentativeness of gesture," a response to society's pluralism of view...[She] pinpoint[s] "the absence of the transcendent" as American poetry's most haunting loss and enumerates post-modernist strengths in her most intriguing, elliptical style...Vendler's anthology does what most anthologies do: It gives poets and critics more cause for argument--and perhaps provides new insight into which lyrics...can be called truly American. (Carol Muske <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>The anthology that Vendler has assembled...is both personal and revisionist, revealing her particular vision of the canon of recent American poetry (though Vendler of course knows that it is not critics or anthologists in the end who determine our canons)...On the crucial question to be asked of a collection like this--how well does it represent the best developments in the era it covers? Vendler has done her work so well that it will surely be many years before anyone does it better. (<i>Yale Review</i>)<br><br>In her present capacity as poetry review for the <i>New Yorker</i>, and (in the past) for the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, Helen Vendler has been most influentially involved in deciding exactly which volumes are to be deemed memorable. She is the best close reader of poems to found on the literary pages, and she exercises, by common consent, a powerful role in the establishment of poetic reputation on the trans-Atlantic scene. She is judicious but not mealy-mouthed and operates with as firm a sense of what she would resist as what she favours.

He read modern languages at King&#39;s College, Cambridge and later took a B.Sc. degree in decorative horticulture at Wye College, University of London. In 1954 he returned to Great Dixter in Northiam, near Rye, where he started a nursery for clematis and other plants. From the early 1950s the manor house which was bought in 1910 by his father, Nathaniel Lloyd, was opened regularly to the public. Christopher was a pioneer and famously outspoken and critical of unimaginative gardening. In 1979 he was given the highest award of the Royal Horticultural Society, the Victoria Medal of Honour. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Open University in 1996 and was appointed OBE in 2000. He was a regular contributor to Country Life, the Guardian and the Observer. Lloyd will be remembered longest for his many books. The Mixed Border first appeared in 1957, followed by Clematis in 1965 and The Well-Tempered Garden in 1970. His many books have remained in print over the decades and are read worldwide. He launched a trend himself with his book Foliage Plants (1973) and in the 1990s, when in his late seventies, was leading fashion by the nose towards the use of subtropical plants in his exotic garden at Great Dixter. He loved to mix the old and the new in all spheres, and would regularly commission modern furniture for the ancient interiors of Great Dixter. Cooking was a passion for Lloyd cooking expertly for great numbers and his book, Gardener Cook was published in 1998. Christopher died on 27th January, 2006 aged 84.</p><h2>Dancing with Broken Bones: Portraits of Death and Dying among Inner-City Poor</h2><p>This book tells the stories of patients whose stories are typically not told: the urban dying poor.

The book covers the transition from Newtonian to Einsteinian behaviour for electrons, the relativistic expressions for mass, momentum and energy of particles. Later chapters cover the Lorentz transformations, the laws of kinematics and dynamics according to special relativity. The approach taken is traditional in that it does not rest heavily on electromagnetic theory. However, the final chapter deals with some of the insights that relativity can provide with regard to the relationship between electricity and magnetism. &#34;Real&#34; examples are used and there are problems for students to tackle. Answers are given. This book should be of interest to undergraduate courses in introductory physics and physical sciences.</p><p></p><h2>Biological Psychology: An Introduction to Behavioral, Cognitive, and Clinical Neuroscience</h2><p>Biological Psychology is a comprehensive survey of the biological bases of behavior that is authoritative and up-to-date.

While there are many publications about the history of the Situationist International, New Babylonians offers unique coverage of how their tactics are currently employed in architectural and urban strategies. It features renowned architects and educators who were first generation Situationists and also highlights some of the most exciting international practitioners involved in urban design today.<br> * Contains contributions from an impressive roster of academics, designers, writers, and art practitioners<br> * Offers timely and lively insights about contemporary urban architecture and art</p><p>Renowned for its decadence and hanging gardens, ancient Babylon was a cosmopolitan cultural centre which established the civic principles of freedom and law. In 1959, a member of the Situationist International, the Dutch artist Constant Nieuwenhuys, entitled his utopian vision of a unitary urbanism "New Babylon". With the aid of coloured perspectives, plans and models, as well as a potent narrative, Constant delivered a shocking image of a metropolitan future.<br> <br> Today over 40 years later, there is a renewed interest in Constant and the thinking of the Situationist International. In two seminal essays by Mark Wigley and David Pinder, quite how substantial their impact on urbanism has been revealed. It is, however, through the publication that a highly disparate group of architectural practices and cultural thinkers emerge - the New Babylonians - all inspired in very different ways by situationism.</p><h2>Hard Road West: History and Geology along the Gold Rush Trail</h2><p>In 1848 news of the discovery of gold in California triggered an enormous wave of emigration toward the Pacific. Lured by the promise of riches, thousands of settlers left behind the forests, rain, and fertile soil of the eastern United States in favor of the rough-hewn lands of the American West. The dramatic terrain they struggled to cross is so familiar to us now that it is hard to imagine how frightening&#x2014;even godforsaken&#x2014;its sheer rock faces and barren deserts seemed to our forebears.<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><i>Hard Road West</i> brings their perspective vividly to life, weaving together the epic overland journey of the covered wagon trains and the compelling story of the landscape they encountered. Taking readers along the 2,000-mile California Trail, Keith Meldahl uses the diaries and letters of the settlers themselves&#x2014;as well as the countless hours he has spent following the trail&#x2014;to reveal how the geology and geography of the West directly affected our nation&#x2019;s westward expansion. He guides us through a corrugated landscape of sawtooth mountains, following the meager streams that served as lifelines through an arid land, all the way to California itself, where colliding tectonic plates created breathtaking scenery and planted the gold that lured travelers west in the first place.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Alternates seamlessly between vivid accounts of the 19th-century journey and lucid explanations of the geological events that shaped the landscape traveled. . . .

He writes very well and, in the tradition of the best 19th-century accounts, he does not hesitate to put himself in the story. . . . Here&#x2019;s a book that not only informs but is fun to read.&#x201d; (John Mack Faragher <i>Truthdig</i>)<br><br>"Meldahl has succeeded admirably in interweaving two compelling historical narratives. One is the overland migration of settlers heading west to California in the 1840s and 1850s. The other is the geological history of the North American continent, particularly as it has slowly moved west over the last 200 million years. The resulting narrative structure alternates seamlessly between vivid accounts of the 19th-century journey and lucid explanations of the geological events that shaped the landscape traveled. Meldahl makes profuse and effective use of firsthand quotes from journals and letters, historical and contemporary photographs, and geological diagrams. The reader comes away with both an appreciation for the arduous cross-continental wagon journey and an understanding of the events that created such a vast and difficult landscape. This book allows us to experience vicariously the last time in history that travelers across North America had to confront, personally and physically, the features of the landscape on a daily basis. Highly recommended." (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Fans of John McPhee will find many familiar pleasures in <i>Hard Road West</i><i>.</i>&nbsp;Keith Meldahl is equally adept at explaining the science behind the western landscape as he is at evoking the personalities and emotions of the people who struggled to cross it.&nbsp;His love of the land and his admiration for the emigrants shine from every page.&#x201d;</p> (Alan Cutler, author of The Seashell on the Mountaintop)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Western historians and trail rut nuts alike have good reason to rejoice that Keith Meldahl stopped to ponder a California Trail marker on the Forty-Mile Desert and asked, &#x2018;What&#x2019;s this all about?&#x2019; <i>Hard Road West</i> creates an entirely new look at one of America&#x2019;s greatest stories, combining perceptive scientific observations with brilliant, engaging, captivating prose to tell the tale of America&#x2019;s road to gold.

Many emigrant accounts describe the challenging landscape of the western United States and the difficulties encountered in crossing it, but explanations of the origin of that landscape for the general-interest reader have been lacking. This book fills that need by clearly and thoroughly describing the geological processes that created and shaped the American West. Meldahl keeps scientific jargon to a minimum, using everyday language and familiar examples to provide a geological story that can be understood by any thoughtful reader. Excellent maps and appropriate photographs, along with Meldahl&#x2019;s ever-present humor, enhance the book. Selected excerpts from emigrant diaries illustrate their reactions to the geological features they encountered. Meldahl shows how geology is responsible for these features from the very location of the trails they followed to the curious features that intrigued them and the many hurdles that confronted them. Finally he explains the combination of geological processes necessary to concentrate the gold they cam to find, the reason for their trip in the first place.&#x201d; (Charles W.

The next day German tanks had crossed the Polish border; Britain and France had declared war. Overnight the world had changed, and FDR found himself being forced to consider a dramatically different set of circumstances. <br><br>In <em>Roosevelt's Second Act,</em> Richard Moe focuses on a turning point in American political history: FDR's decision to seek a third term. Often overlooked between the passage and implementation of the New Deal and the bombing of Pearl Harbor, that decision was far from inevitable. As the election loomed, he refused to comment, confiding in no one, scrambling the politics of his own party; but after the Republicans surprisingly nominated Wendell Willkie in July 1940, FDR became convinced that no other Democrat could both maintain the legitimacy of the New Deal and mobilize the nation for war. With Hitler on the verge of conquering Europe, Roosevelt, still hedging, began to maneuver his way to the center of the political stage.<br><br>Moe offers a brilliant depiction of the duality that was FDR: the bold, perceptive, prescient and moral statesman who set lofty and principled goals, and the sometimes cautious, ambitious, arrogant and manipulative politician in pursuit of them. Immersive, insightful and written with an insider's understanding of the presidency, this book challenges and illuminates our understanding of FDR and this pivotal moment in American history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard Moe</strong> was president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation from 1993-2010, chief of staff to Vice President Walter Mondale, and served on President Jimmy Carter's senior staff. His books include <em>The Last Full Measure: The Life and Death of the First Minnesota Volunteers </em>and <em>Changing</em> <em>Places: Rebuilding Community in the Age of Sprawl</em>. He lives in Washington, D.C. and Santa Fe, New Mexico.<br><br>"[Moe] presents in <em>Roosevelt's Second Act: The Election of 1940 and the Politics of War</em> an intensive and nuanced interpretation of a decisive year in American politics and of the man who presided over it....Moe's volume is a worthy addition to Oxford University Press's Pivotal Moments in American History series. <em>Roosevelt's Second Act</em> successfully reaches a general audience, and belongs on the shelf near the works of the author's friends Doris Kearns Goodwin and David McCullough."--<em>H-Net</em><p></p><br>"In Roosevelt's Second Act Richard Moe has shown in superb fashion that what might seem to have been an inevitable decision of comparatively little interest was far from it. But then what could possibly be predictable or uninteresting about such a famously unfathomable protagonist? And what a cast of characters! Moe's long, personal experience in Washington politics, combined with his marked skill as an historian, make this a consistently illuminating reminder that history is above all human, and seldom more so than behind the scenes at a turning point of such importance."--David McCullough <br><p></p><br>"<em>Roosevelt's Second Act</em> is a spellbinding read and a deeply impressive achievement, remarkably detailed and thoroughly researched."--Bernard von Bothmer, <em>History News Network</em> <br><p></p><br>"Trying to understand and explain the complexities of Franklin D. Roosevelt's mind is a daunting task for any historian. Richard Moe is clearly up to the challenge in his fascinating, revelatory account of FDR's fateful decision to run for a third term in 1940, in the midst of the greatest crisis the world has ever faced. Filled with drama and excitement, <em>Roosevelt's Second Act</em> is particularly compelling in its depiction of how two women--Eleanor Roosevelt and Frances Perkins--rescued the president from a political fiasco that could have irrevocably altered history."--Lynne Olson, author of <em>Citizens of London</em> and <em>Those Angry Days</em><p></p><br>"Richard Moe's excellent book reminds us of what great leadership looks like. His beautifully written account of FDR's run for a third term and America's decisive move toward involvement in World War II will stand as the definitive study of this landmark election and a turning point in the country's history."--Robert Dallek<p></p><br>"A carefully focused and researched analysis that adds considerably to the historical record."--<em>Kirkus Reviews, starred review</em><p></p><br>"<em>Roosevelt's Second Act</em> tells the story of a weary president's fateful decision to heed the call of duty in our nation's--and the world's--most perilous hour. Richard Moe's take on an epic tale is deftly-crafted, persuasive in analyzing people and power, and highly relevant to the struggles of our own era; a superb work of living history."--Madeleine Albright<p></p><br>"Most accounts of the Age of Franklin Delano Roosevelt halt with the erosion of the New Deal in 1938 and then lurch forward after Pearl Harbor in 1941. One moment the reader is immersed in Harry Hopkins, the next in Winston Churchill three years later. In this lively, fast-paced tale of the 1940 campaign when FDR sought to break the taboo against serving more than two terms, Richard Moe invites his readers to reflect on a seminal year when the two periods merged.

Psychologist Jennifer Freyd&#39;s breakthrough theory explaining this phenomenon shows how psychogenic amnesia not only happens but, if the abuse occurred at the hands of a parent or caregiver, is often necessary for survival. Freyd&#39;s book will give embattled professionals, beleaguered abuse survivors, and the confused public a new, clear understanding of the lifelong effects and treatment of child abuse.</p><p>Jennifer J. Freyd understands the operation of memory in both professional and personal terms. As an academic psychologist, Professor Freyd has researched the psychological processes of memory and the physiological operation of the mind. In <i>Betrayal Trauma</i>, she uses the generally accepted findings of cognitive science to formulate a psychological theory of recovered memory. But Jennifer J. Freyd's interests and involvement in the study of recovered memories is not strictly academic. During her research, Freyd "uncovered" her own memories of childhood abuse. Her parents, who vehemently denied her allegations, have helped found an organization to support others "falsely accused" by individuals with "recovered memories" of abuse. Freyd's personal stake in the subject matter ironically causes her to go the extra mile in maintaining professional objectivity. While partisan detractors of other stripes will likely disagree, most of Freyd's well-written study sticks to the scientific processes that could supply an explanatory basis for forgetting and remembering traumatic experiences. Freyd mostly eschews victimology. She even considers how artificial memories could be the result of bad psychotherapy. <i>Betrayal Trauma</i> outlines a compelling thesis of how memory operates that addresses a controversial topic with great aplomb.Jennifer Freyd rises above the tawdry shoot-outs of polemic theorists by discarding the arguments that recollections of trauma must be true or false (they can be either and even both). Instead, she explores the logical mechanisms for not knowing: the many faces of knowledge isolation. No wonder, then, that sexual misuse by a trusted caregiver emerges as the most profound yet least remembered of all the possible hardships of childhood. This is a groundbreaking book that reflects clear thinking, cogent research, and profound scholarship.</p><h2>Building Expertise: Cognitive Methods for Training and Performance Improvement</h2><p>This third edition of the classic resource, <i>Building Expertise</i> draws on the most recent evidence on how to build innovative forms of expertise and translates that evidence into guidelines for instructional designers, course developers and facilitators, technical communicators, and other human performance professionals.

He has found a voice for the forgotten souls who haunt the fringes of our culture and for its larger-than-life, real-life figures. His language is defiantly, radiantly American. <br> <br>In <i>The Body Artist</i> his spare, seductive twelfth novel, he inhabits the muted world of Lauren Hartke, an artist whose work defies the limits of the body. Lauren is living on a lonely coast, in a rambling rented house, where she encounters a strange, ageless man, a man with uncanny knowledge of her own life. Together they begin a journey into the wilderness of time, love and human perception.<br> <br><i>The Body Artist</i> is a haunting, beautiful and profoundly moving novel from one of the finest writers of our time.</p><p>Don DeLillo's reputation rests on a series of large-canvas novels, in which he's proven to be the foremost diagnostician of our national psyche. In <i>The Body Artist</i>, however, he sacrifices breadth for depth, narrowing his focus to a single life, a single death. The protagonist is Lauren Hartke, who we see sharing breakfast with her husband, Rey, in the opening pages. This 18-page sequence is a tour de force (albeit a less showy one than the author's initial salvo in <i>Underworld</i>)--an intricate, funny notation of Lauren's consciousness as she pours cereal, peers out the window, and makes idle chat. Rey, alas, will proceed directly from the breakfast table to the home of his former wife, where he'll unceremoniously blow his brains out.<p> What follows is one of the strangest ghost stories since <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>. And like James's tale, it seems to partake of at least seven kinds of ambiguity, leaving the reader to sort out its riddles. Returning to their summer rental after Rey's funeral, Lauren discovers a strange stowaway living in a spare room: an inarticulate young man, perhaps retarded, who may have been there for weeks. His very presence is hard for her to pin down: "There was something elusive in his aspect, moment to moment, a thinning of physical address." Yet soon this mysterious figure begins to speak in Rey's voice, and her own, playing back entire conversations from the days preceding the suicide. Has Lauren's husband been reincarnated? Or is the man simply an eavesdropping idiot savant, reproducing sentences he'd heard earlier from his concealment?</p><p> DeLillo refuses any definitive answer. Instead he lets Lauren steep in her grief and growing puzzlement, and speculates in his own voice about this apparent intersection of past and present, life and death. At times his rhetoric gets away from him, an odd thing for such a superbly controlled writer. "How could such a surplus of vulnerability find itself alone in the world?" he asks, sounding as though he's discussing a sick puppy. And Lauren's performances--for she is the body artist of the title--sound pretty awful, the kind of thing Artaud might have cooked up for an aerobics class. Still, when DeLillo reins in the abstractions and bears down, the results are heartbreaking: </p><blockquote> Why shouldn't the death of a person you love bring you into lurid ruin? You don't know how to love the ones you love until they disappear abruptly. Then you understand how thinly distanced from their suffering, how sparing of self you often were, only rarely unguarded of heart, working your networks of give-and-take. </blockquote> At this stage of his career, a thin book is an adventure for DeLillo. So is his willingness to risk sentimentality, to immerse us in personal rather than national traumas. For all its flaws, then, <i>The Body Artist</i> is a real, raw accomplishment, and a reminder that bigger, even for so capacious an imagination as DeLillo's, isn't <i>always</i> better. <i>--James Marcus</i>Don DeLillo is the author of fifteen novels, including <i>Zero K</i>, <i>Underworld</i>, <i>Falling Man</i>,<i> White Noise</i>, and <i>Libra</i>.

While art historians have wrestled with these images and objects, very few scientists have weighed in on Paleolithic art as artifacts of a complex, living society. R. Dale Guthrie is one of the first to do so, and his monumental volume <i>The Nature of Paleolithic Art</i> is a landmark study that will change the shape of our understanding of these marvelous images.<br><br>With a natural historian's keen eye for observation, and as one who has spent a lifetime using bones and other excavated materials to piece together past human behavior and environments, Guthrie demonstrates that Paleolithic art is a mode of expression we can comprehend to a remarkable degree and that the perspective of natural history is integral to that comprehension. He employs a mix of ethology, evolutionary biology, and human universals to access these distant cultures and their art and artifacts. Guthrie uses innovative forensic techniques to reveal new information; estimating, for example, the ages and sexes of some of the artists, he establishes that Paleolithic art was not just the creation of male shamans.<br><br>With more than 3,000 images, <i>The Nature of Paleolithic Art</i> offers the most comprehensive representation of Paleolithic art ever published and a radical (and controversial) new way of interpreting it. The variety and content of these images&#x2014;most of which have never been available or easily accessible to nonspecialists or even researchers&#x2014;will astonish you. This wonderfully written work of natural history, of observation and evidence, tells the great story of our deepest past.</p><p><b>R.

Guthrie brings his expertise in zoology, paleontology and modern hunting to the study of cave paintings and other preserved remnants of our Paleolithic ancestors, proposing a revolutionary rethinking of how our ancestors lived.. . . This immensely thought-provoking book will challenge readers' preconceptions about the origin of art and the provenance of our family and social structures."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"A fascinating and compulsive read in which Guthrie harnesses a gamut of anthropological data and rock-art images. Despite this, it is a controversial book."

(<i>Fossil News</i>)<br><br>"Guthrie offers numerous provocative hypotheses about the makers of art and its place within the context of Palaeolithic daily life. Proponents of shamanism will likely find much of this monograph incendiary. . . . For all readers, his approachable style makes the book highly readable and at times witty. As the culmination of several decades of work, Guthrie's monograph provides a much needed, original perspective on the 'nature' of Paleolithic art." (Rebecca A. Farbstein <i>Archaeological Review from Cambridge</i>)<br><br>"An extremely interesting and generally easily readable text. . . . In breaking away from more conventional magico-religious interpretations of Paleolithic imagery, [Guthrie] presents an intriguing vision of our distant ancestors and especially of the role played by a hunting lifestyle in providing the spark that ignited mankind's imagination and released his inherent creativity." (Danny A. Brass <i>NSS News</i>)<br><br>"[The book] offers readers fascinating informaiton about and challenging interpretations of Paleolithic art.

In one word, an altar is a gateway in the realm of the invisible. By implication, therefore, no matter the plan and the purpose of God for your life, family, children, relationships, businesses, communities, and other personal endeavours, you must have the spiritual understanding that, until satanic and demonic altars in your foundation are overthrown, you are most likely to fall short of God&#x2019;s plan for your life. No wonder God commanded Moses, &#x201c;You must destroy their altars...&#x201d; (Exodus 34:13-14). In this book, Pastor Uzor Ndekwu draws from his many years of experience as a deliverance minister to explain why you must overthrow foundational altars, and why you must confront demonic or satanic altars erected to hinder or frustrate God&#x2019;s plans for you and your family.</p><p>Pastor Uzor Ndekwu is the General Overseer of Jesus Sanctuary Ministries Worldwide and a renowned deliverance minister. He is a teacher of the Word of God with deep spiritual insight, a tele-evangelist who has taken his deliverance message to many countries in Africa and Europe. His powerful ministrations are followed by signs and wonders. He has unusual prophetic insight into dreams and visions from a biblical perspective. A former member of the management staff of a leading bank in Nigeria, Pastor Uzor answered the call of God upon his life in 2001. He is married to Pastor (Mrs) Uzo, and they have three, wonderful children.</p><h2>Journey to the Center of the Earth (Illustrated First Edition): 100th Anniversary Collection with Foreword</h2><p><b>Beautiful edition with all 60 first edition illustrations and a Foreword by the translator Frederick Malleson.</b><br><b>SeaWolf Press</b> is proud to offer another book in its <b>Jules Verne 100th Anniversary Collection</b>.

White settlers, free to pour into the West, clashed as never before with Indian tribes struggling to defend their way of life. In the Northwest, Pontiac's War brought racial conflict to its bitterest level so far. Whole ethnic groups migrated, sometimes across the continent: it was 1763 that saw many exiled settlers from Acadia in French Canada move again to Louisiana, where they would become Cajuns. Calloway unfurls this panoramic canvas with vibrant narrative skill, peopling his tale with memorable characters such as William Johnson, the Irish baronet who moved between Indian campfires and British barracks; Pontiac, the charismatic Ottawa chieftain; and James Murray, Britains first governor in Quebec, who fought to protect the religious rights of his French Catholic subjects. <br><br>Most Americans know the significance of the Declaration of Independence or the Emancipation Proclamation, but not the Treaty of Paris. Yet 1763 was a year that shaped our history just as decisively as 1776 or 1862. This captivating book shows why. <br> <br> <strong>Winner of the Society of Colonial Wars Book Award for 2006</strong><br></p><p><br><strong>Colin G.

Vance's narration brings clarity to the production as he is adept at indicating with subtle intonation when he is reading quotes from historical documents and when he is reading Calloway's narrative. The text needed a respected veteran narrator to counter its somewhat monotonous subject matter. The Indians didn't like the British, who didn't like the French, who didn't like the . . . you get the idea. It's interesting to note, though, how many of the centuries-old ethnic enclaves across Eastern and Midwest states survive today.

In showing how an overriding concern with religious salvation was transformed into a concentration on material increase and economic policies, Smith depicts the rise of modern science and early capitalism. In pursuing this narrative, she focuses on that ideal prey of the cultural historian, an intellectual of the second rank whose career and ideas typify those of a generation. Smith follows the career of Johann Joachim Becher (1635-1682) from university to court, his projects from New World colonies to an old-world Pansophic Panopticon, and his ideas from alchemy to economics. Teasing out the many meanings of alchemy for Becher and his contemporaries, she argues that it provided Becher with not only a direct key to power over nature but also a language by which he could convince his princely patrons that their power too must rest on liquid wealth.</p><p>Agrarian society regarded merchants with suspicion as the nonproductive exploiters of others' labor; however, territorial princes turned to commerce for revenue as the cost of maintaining the state increased. Placing Becher's career in its social and intellectual context, Smith shows how he attempted to help his patrons assimilate commercial values into noble court culture and to understand the production of surplus capital as natural and legitimate. With emphasis on the practices of natural philosophy and extensive use of archival materials, Smith brings alive the moment of cultural transformation in which science and the modern state emerged.</p></p><p><p>"No one has described with such authority and with the career of one of those projectors who haunted the courts of late Renaissance and Baroque Europe like so many Pied Pipers, offering philosophers' stones and irresistible weapons to any monarch who would offer them an open ear trumpet. Pamela Smith's book, in short, is fascinating, elegant, and incisive."<b>--Anthony Grafton, Princeton University</b></p><b>Pamela H.

The structural elements of this text will allow the instructor to incorporate these student-centered teaching methods into their Earth Science course. The authors have tested the book&#x2019;s content and pedagogy in large Earth Science classes for non-majors that are populated with mostly freshmen. Their experiences show that the materials and methods in <i>The Good Earth</i> can improve students&#x2019; learning, increase daily attendance, reduce attrition, and increase students&#x2019; enthusiasm in comparison with classes taught following a traditional lecture format.&nbsp;<br>The authors have chosen to emphasize three scientific themes throughout the text: i) scientific literacy; ii) Earth Science and the human experience; and, iii) the science of global change. The discussion of scientific methods is woven into the text throughout. They have included numerous examples of human interaction with the Earth that can serve as entry points for students to appreciate the nature of science. Global change is a theme that is evident in much current Earth Science research so our authors have used global change as a content theme throughout the book.</p><p></p><h2>The Poems of Marianne Moore</h2><p><b>A Penguin Classic</b><br><br>This complete collection of Moore&#x2019;s poetry, lovingly edited by prize-winning poet Grace Schulman, for the first time gathers together all of Moore&#x2019;s poems, including more than a hundred that were previously uncollected and unpublished.

After graduation from Bryn Mawr College in 1909 she taught for four years at the Carlisle Indian School. Her poetry first appeared professionally in <b>The Egoist</b> and <b>Poetry</b> magazines in 1915 and she moved to New York City in 1918. Her first book, <b>Poems</b>, was issued in England by the Egoist Press in 1921. <b>Observations</b>, published three years later in America, received the Dial Award. From 1925 to 1929 she served as acting editor of <b>The Dial</b>, the preeminent American literary periodical. She moved to Brooklyn in 1929, where she lived for the next thirty-six years. In 1935 <b>Selected Poems</b>, with an Introduction by T.S. Eliot, brought her work to the attention of a wider public. <p>Three additional books of poetry were followed, in 1951, by her <b>Collected Poems</b>, which won the Bollingen Prize, the National Book Award, and the Pulitzer Prize. She went on to publish a verse translation of the complete <b>Fables of La Fontaine</b>, a collection of critical essays, and three more volumes of poems.</p><p>Among the many awards Marianne Moore received are the National Institute of Arts and Letters Gold Medal for poetry, the Poetry Scoiety of America's Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement, and the National Medal for Literature, America's highest literary honor. A member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters since 1947, she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1955. In 1967 she was made Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Republic, and in 1969 she received an honorary doctorate in literature from Harvard University, her sixteenth honorary degree. Marianne Moore died in New York City, in her eighty-fifth year, on February 5, 1972.</p><p></p><p> "Her eyes are different from ours, instead of a flashing whole, her mind sees first and they obey its orders in microscopic detail." So wrote Winifred Bryher about her friend Marianne Moore in the 1920s. Anyone reading Grace Schulman's new edition of Moore's poems would do well to keep this comment handy. For the poetry is so full of "eye" that it almost seems to be a visual art.</p><p> Moore's originality has been examined at length quite cunningly by poet-critics ranging from T.S. Eliot to Robert Pinsky. Still, her poems tend to elude those critics whose eyes and minds cannot keep up with the multiple exposures of Moore's oncoming visual details. To reread her now, 31 years after her death at 85, is to wonder how much further an eye could possibly go. Not much, I'd say. So for now, let our eye look at hers. </p><p> Looking backward, then, align your mindful eye with the image Moore conjures in "The Sycamore": "Against a gun-metal sky/ I saw an albino giraffe." Consider, in "Sea Unicorns and Land Unicorns," one of those fabled creatures "etched like an equine monster of an old celestial map." Squint at "An Octopus," "its claw cut by the avalanche." Study her pangolin, with his "sting-proof scales; and nest/ of rocks closed with earth from inside, which he can thus darken." Or watch her herd of elephants: "a/ religious procession without any priests,/ the centuries-old carefullest unrehearsed/ play." And do not neglect the snake of which Moore writes, in her poem "Snakes, Mongooses, Snake-Charmers, and the Like": "one is compelled to look at it as at the shadows of the Alps/ imprisoning in their folds like flies in amber the rhythms of the skating-rink." Here one metaphor foments another with an excitingly exact series of persuasive mixed metaphors.</p><p>Not for nothing did Moore choose to adorn a work with the wistful title "I May, I Might, I Must." For a slow and scrupled writer such as she was, any poem represented a continent of choices. Her fellow poet William Carlos Williams explained the nature of the challenge, and her response: "With Miss Moore a word is a word most when it is separated out by silence, treated with acid to remove the smudges, washed, dried and placed right side up on a clean surface. Now one may say that this is a word. Now it may be used, and how?"</p><p> Moore was known to confess that she had first hoped to be a visual artist. As a Bryn Mawr College senior, she seriously considered attending the Lyme School of Art in Connecticut following her graduation. Many years later, composing some of her best poems in Brooklyn, she wrote and revised, revised and wrote, while sunning herself on the roof of her apartment building. Light, sight, insight, writing: for her all were essentially conjoined. "Yes, light is speech," wrote Moore in a poem. "Free frank/ impartial sunlight, moonlight,/ starlight, lighthouse light,/ are language." She preferred to perceive and penetrate a surface, yet not relinquish it. Tension then ensued between depth and surface, yielding the insight. (Or as Moore, also a revelatory essayist, succinctly pronounced it: "Form is synonymous with content.")</p><p> Holding a fine balance between description and analysis, Moore's poems enchant the reader while reflecting her own enchantment with language. As Morton Dauwen Zabel, her editor at Poetry magazine, noticed, her "sincere and ruthless insight" made her able and willing to "combine the functions of critic and poet in one performance." Schulman's edition of Moore's poetry is needed for a fair appreciation of that performance, for the poet's own fastidiousness led to an unusual publication history: She chose to exclude some of her poems from various collections, imposed drastically revised versions of certain poems on certain volumes, and accepted or mandated orderings of poems within their books that at times made it difficult even for seasoned readers to assess her chronological development. Schulman's edition readjusts Moore's body of work respectfully and generously by restoring lost or overlooked poems in logical sequence, and by lifting the veil on their sundry revised versions.</p><p>How many of Moore's poems do we now have? Her Collected Poems (1981) consists of 130. The Poems of Marianne Moore offers 263, so Schulman introduces readers to more than a hundred poems previously unpublished or uncollected in book form. Moore wrote the bulk of them between the ages of 20 and 26, before she moved to New York City and swiftly became known to an inner circle of poets, editors and poetry critics. Three-fifths of these restored poems have not been previously published anywhere, making this collection a work of excavation and rescue.</p><p> One fruit of the excavation: A reader is able to realize the remarkable feat of Moore's emergence from authoring epigrammatic verse to, you might say, inventing a poetry of epic wants and tendencies. An epigram compresses adroitly a mass of knowledge, thanks to the writer's unquenchable wit; Moore later wrote on a much larger scale without abandoning the epigrammatic yen for unmatched precision, for what she called "exact perception." In this she reigned peerless, even after achieving ultimately in poetry her more complex goal of building a "chain of interactingly/ linked harmony." Time after time, the early poems gathered by Schulman show a writer pausing before making that leap. (Compare "Things Are What They Seem" with "Piningly," an early rehearsal of her flight to come, or with "Old Tiger," where she fulfills her promise. Also, in the early poems one can find precociously pure statements of poetic or moral belief, as in her lines "One associates the love of beauty/ with a wish to see it exemplified." Although she wrote the sentence well before she had obeyed fully its implied guidance, Moore was ever a writer of exempla, as Schulman demonstrates: Although in her poems Moore sought to think, she did it with and through details that carry a moral significance. To read her very early four-line poem "A Fish" alongside her subsequent 40-line poem "The Fish" is to see this plainly and magnificently. The poems flicker, steadfastly visual, throughout these pages. They are, as she demanded of art in "When I Buy Pictures," "lit with piercing glances into the life of things." </p><p> Even now, a novel and a memoir by Moore both remain unpublished, and her 10-year labor of translation, the complete Fables of La Fontaine, seems to have gone out of print -- all sad omissions of publishers, or maybe just bad luck.</p><p> Still, at last we have all of her poems, at least. </p><p></p><p>Reviewed by Molly McQuade</p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.
